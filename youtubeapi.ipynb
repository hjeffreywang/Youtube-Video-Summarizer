      "activity let's go through though Tom Lee's kind of prediction here for October now it's pretty much in line with what we've been discussing the idea that you should be a little bit more terrified in October is probably valid you can see here in similar situation setups Tom Lee has found that only 22% of the time markets are actually up and October has been down seven of the last nine times with November coming through with the goods now this is good information and of course we should be bringing this in in line with our technical analysis that we'll look through later on does it make sense to the options flow as well we'll check that out soon but as Ryan detric says and as we've been sharing with the data recently you still need to look at it in the picture of the overall next 3 months at the moment it looks like the markets are trying to price in a no Landing soft Landing style situation and in similar stats where we've had 5 Monon wi streak since 1950 usually you've had a pretty good next 12- month period you can also see here that whenever we have these\n",

      "types of periods where we've had 10 of the last 11 months up again it tends to mean that strength ends up being more strength in markets and of course there will eventually be some type of Black Swan but as we've thought about and we've looked at we're not seeing some of the weakest signs yet I do have ways of reading this and at the moment the bonds Market's not freaking me out neither is leverage neither is of course the massive amount of liquidity that's going in thanks to the pboc and the Federal Reserve they're pushing along basically a slowing and lagging economy and this is what happens often these kind of late bull cycle or mid to late cycle kind of markets they tend to lead into these periods and you can see here Tom Lee is also using some of these no Landing style scenarios to forecast the next 3 and six months could have a 100% win record behind them so has Tesla shown us something here about weakness in the economy well they released their figures and of course most Tesla people that love Tesla will be like that's pretty\n",

      "sometimes we have to look for rotation and this doesn't mean that I absolutely hate utilities or anything I still think it's got a pretty bright future ahead of it even though it's the most boring sector in the world because and thanks to mostly AI but you can see on this chart the over performance of utilities and the underperformance of energy I think it's really demonstrated well here by J research and I like it very much so basically 18.5% utilities has smashed it kick the kick the crap out of the S&P 500 and that is not something you usually tend to see so uh some very strong movements there and as you know this kind of really went along with a lot of our thought processes now why could I say utilities might be going into a bit of a sideways Market well not only the technical analysis that we'll bring up later on but have a look here at the moving average deviation you can see that we are super above Jason gford over on X saying that utilities now trading 20% above their 200 day moving average this has only happened once in October 2000 and it lasted for one day\n",
      "\n",
      "uh that's not a great sign for my utilities for now but I don't think it's as bad as this chart Ryan dri also posting I I think this one comes from uh Dean Christians and basically you can see here that whenever we've traded super high on utilities then we tend to move into a period of significant underperformance 22% of the time this happens and the annualized return is 20% so of course I believe that you is going to Buck this trend a little bit but still pretty damning evidence when it comes to one of our favorite sectors some other data coming out obviously that we've shared before these are all these extra basically strong months end up causing further strong months again feeding upon themselves is one we shared in our previous video this week's non-farm payrolls now if you're not aware of it this is what JP Morgan believes is kind of going to happen in terms of percentages kind of their game plan and what they think so if you're watching if you're interested in knowing what the jobs numb might do this is what\n",

      "JP Morgan thinks they are but I would always take that with a grain of salt now let's talk about China now we alerted you guys and of course we've all been doing this together to China in terms of flows first we saw the TA improving then we already knew the short interest was superiorly high so what has this been it's been a massive short squeeze on the hangsang and Chinese markets and you can see here that the 10-day Advance decline has gone ballistic now that's a great sign if you were in it early but I think maybe the short squeeze is over for now now there are a few reasons mostly dark pool related in the moment but basically this is probably a turning point for China now that they've started this of course Central Bank methodology of saying we're going to do whatever it takes we've already seen probably about a 40 basis point GDP Improvement thanks to monetary flow we will see the market crack it multiple times over the next year where it says we want more we want more we want more and it will sell off and\n",

      "all right all right today's spy was up 0.4% so an extremely exciting flat day of going absolutely nowhere in intraday we did get very close to retesting that all-time high breakout at 565 and I do believe below that level you should be very quick to get bearish because below that level we will likely go down towards 560 and 556 and likely even lower than that if we slice through those support zones now if we do hold above 565 there's no reason to be bearish because we could still Bounce from a higher low off of the retest of the previous all-time high and still go higher to hit a brand new all-time high price Target at 581 and the confirmation of that bull breakout would be the break and close above a brand new all-time high which would be above 574 to 575 so the bullish scenario is possible but I do believe a lot of risk is going to be to the downside if spy fails to hold that very critical support at 565 and if you are looking for an excuse to get bearish you are starting to get it today\n",

      "Campbell says not just Israel that is thinking about response options to Iran attack the US is too so this could happen tonight it's currently about midnight in the Middle East right now we may get more news of this tomorrow what Israel has done in response to Iran and that's why we've seen a swift move up in energy stocks this week big volume coming in there yesterday XLE xon mobile multi-on breakout and gold the stained bid as well geopolitical risk premium built in there still got uranium pushing up and other Commodities as well there's wheat Futures breaking out in volume corn ticking higher Sugar's being on a run and just the commodity index as a whole which has been weak for a few months now maybe breaking out from this downtrend St need to push up here and so once again curious timing isn't it all this stuff been escalated 4 weeks out from the US federal election and just looking at this Global geopolitical Risk Index and this isn't just some chart from a small website this is actually compiled by fed economists and no doubt when we get the latest print on this chart it's going to spike up again and that's pretty much been the trend ever since there was a change of power in the US it had been trending down in the prior four years getting down to record\n",

      "lows the prior Administration broken peace deals in the Middle East cooled tensions with North Korea and Russia and even though we had a trade war with China there was no risk for military conflict however then there was The Botch withdrawal from Afghanistan then Russia saw that as the us being soft footed started planning their invasion in Ukraine which they did 5 months later and ever since then we've had the most heightened geopolitics tensions that we've seen in many of our lifetime and we're pretty much right on the verge now of a direct large scale regional conflict between Iran and Israel and the states cuz Iran said they're going to respond back if Israel attacks them directly so this is only escalating and escalating also at a time when Ukraine's looking to use Western weapons to strike deep within Russia again all of this happening just 4 weeks out from the US federal election and there's a look at the economic calendar for today ADP employment coming in a lot hotter than expected few more fed speakers looking out tomorrow we've got services pmis and Friday non-farm payrolls unemployment rate expected to come in 4.2% and for the Here and Now Market still given almost 2/3 chance the FED will only cut\n",

      "little bit higher NASDAQ Peak the fallowing week got the reversal bar S&P remember it diverged with NASDAQ at that time it went a little bit higher into the June 16th or July 16th High NASDAQ peaked on July 10th the week before verg is so often the case I think they're going to do that now but you have an eight of a nine the eight or nine bar could be the high of the count here in the weekly time frame sometimes you get a nine count you go a little bit higher that's why I said give or take it's a rule of thumb the rate Cuts First Rate cut 3 and A2 almost 4 Weeks Later those rallies come to a conclusion the end of full cycle and turning shift into the bare Market see the same thing here so again I'm looking to see if we get a top now as you're getting these weekly charts 8 n eight bar could be the high of the count the nine bar could be the high of the count we'll be watching to see how it unfolds so I think he got a good shot uh again that we see a top either this week or next week uh on the S&P 500 but I think that nasdaq's likely\n",
      "\n",
      "going to fill that Gap in order to give it to us on the S&P we'll see if we close out strong with the jobs report this week we start seeing weakness and maybe the count doesn't complete we'll see what happens as we close above the bar from four weeks ago I we'll continue so just something to pay attention to this is the S&P you got the same exact count on the Dow they're both going up into those major long-term trend lines now as we're getting the 8 of n forming these diverences all over the place triple diverences all the place on indicators we could still go up and hit the upper boundary of the channel my guess was that's going to be the case but again you should be aware performing these eight of nine counts again we had these diverences all over the place on the S&P 500 hard to find an indicator that doesn't have a a Divergence developing or a triple Divergence I'm talking about a diverence happening on the RSI in the most recent price action but you have this larger diversions developing here from the July Peak and very similar to what we had back over here in January talked about this a great length in detail so again I\n",
      "\n",
      "think we're going to get one more push higher in all likelihood I think we're going to complete those diversions I could be wrong if we start seeing signals all begin to turn bearish and start allowing the weekly divergences to play out think you get a peak either this week or next week give or take as I said a rule of thumb got these diverences here's a triple Divergence with momentum uh again we'll see how we close a week out we'll see if we rally with the jobs report up into this area or so uh but my guess is again we're still going to move higher but a lot of triple diversion is everywhere uh on the weekly chart it's just all over the place on the weekly on the weekly charts happening as the Russells making a lower high snp's made a higher high recently and uh again they're diverging from one another I think this diversion will play out on the Russell uh I think the Russell will uh make a lower high lower than the peak over here and they diverge at the top when S&P made a uh higher\n",
      "\n",
      "high in 2022 the Russell made a lower high and that is what happens uh surrounding tops okay I want to just continue to monitor these diersen as are going to play out soon here's the RSI uh nice looking Divergence here if we take it all the way back from over here you've got a really nice looking triple diversion we had this diversion uh give us this sill off of nearly U 10% or so just under 10% look at the diversions on the macd this is going to play out very soon it looks very similar to this one one this price action here looks very similar to this price action here the RSI looks very similar and I think you're going to go a little higher I could be wrong about that if we start seeing everything start turning bearish but these divergences are going to play out and we're getting these divergences as we're just under this upper Channel wi and we're getting an eight of a nine count this week on the S&P so I think again you got a good shot of peing either this week or next week perly that's been the case we'll see if it is or not using probability I'm not trying to predict the future oh it's going to happen on such and such day at such and such time I'm using Common Sense\n",
      "\n",
      "probability of what likely outcome as we get the FED pivot and these negative diverences form prob ability is we're likely going to Peak top out start to reverse these diverences play out that's probability whether that happens immediately or whether you know later in the week or on into next week or thereafter I'm looking for a top I think it's probably going to happen here in the next two weeks I think he got a good shot of it developing uh here in the next two weeks uh in all likelihood\n"
