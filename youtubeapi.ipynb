      "tell your friends and get them to like this video and leave a comment for the algorithm it really really helps me out let's get into it this is the weekly heat map of the S&P 500 now we can actually see a lot of red a lot of green but the big players that really move the market did really do a lot of the heavy lifting look at Apple up 8% for the week that really did help the tech sector as a whole especially Nvidia here on semiconductors Microsoft finished flat after being down nearly 9% here in April and then Google and meta we're doing their own thing now Google down 2.7% for the week and that's because it was up 9% last week we're also going to talk about Google a little later on in the video we saw Tesla put up another 7% and then Amazon 3% up for the week that did coincide with quite a lot of drama as well here in energy as well as financials they really did exhibit quite a bit of weakness here in the week other than that you know we saw green here in utilities P the market getting a bit jittery a bit defensive early on in the week we saw Green in real estate because of the rate cut sit situation as well as\n",

      "some of these defensive sectors there were winners there were losers such goes the market now looking at sectors from a weekly basis we could see a couple of things as well utilities was actually the best sector for the week so a bit of a defensive trade and then we had Regional Banks and home construction as the next best sectors at 3% and 1.63% followed by XLR great sensitive sectors were the highlight of this weak point we actually saw semiconductors were relatively flat for the week despite the outperformance that we did see in technology and I think a lot of people people are rotating from semiconductors into technology because the discrepancy between them is quite significant semiconductors trade at an average of about 32x xlk trades at about 27x so those that do want exposure to technology are just probably going for the cheaper option at least that's what I saw in the flows this week but we did see commodity driven sectors we did see commodity driven sectors look at GDX look at XLE lose this week and that was because of the inflation narrative that weak jobs report as well as weaker pmis meant right cuts are coming and that's\n",
      "\n",
      "why we saw cyclical outperformed we did see a bit of defensive buying as well and then rate sensitive sectors really did do the most but if we actually have a look at the majors we saw bonds for the week put out 1.18% here in the TLT iwm not far behind up 1.78% Commodities took it on the chin all week particularly after Monday printing lower lows and lower highs pretty much all week until it found a bottom here on Thursday and this was largely driven by a bunch of the macro factors and disinflationary drivers leading up to the NFP report as well as the PMI numbers they were pretty bad here on Tuesday as well as here on Friday but excluding Commodities it was really here on Wednesday early Thursday where we put in a bottom possibly a double bottom and then we really saw markets come to life rallying towards the end of the week equities rallied bonds rallied on that news as well look at TLT iwm Dow Jones the NASDAQ the S&P 500 even the RSP but you do have to look at this in aggregate the RSP was pretty much flat for the week and that's because we spent the majority of the week here in negative territory it was\n",

      "only really after Thursday late Thursday into Friday that we really saw us flip positive for the week thanks to the mega caps thanks to stocks like apple we going to talk about the RSP now I want to talk about the broader market and its equal weight in the market and its effect on the rally instead of the S&P 500 I would go ahead and talk about small Caps or midcaps but do take into consideration that midcaps and the RSP trade roughly the same the charts look the same they they move very very similarly and iwm is simply 4% of the stock market it doesn't have a big overall weight on what's actually happening and I do think that the S&P 500 right now and the equal weight have a bigger weight as to what's actually going on in the overall stock market right now than the iwm but let's dive in we're actually going to start here at the weekly chart so you can definitely see we are in an uptrend in the RSP making higher lows as we continue and then we also made an all-time high right here and now we're also putting another higher low so you have to understand that on a weekly chart until we probably\n",
      "\n",
      "breach this level right here and at worst this level right here we are still in a technical uptrend and we do want to look to buy dips at these levels reaching for all-time highs in the RSP now we can actually just zoom in a little bit and we can see some very glaring things very similar to the RSP we've actually been in a balance range right here for quite some time call it a correction in time some people like to call it a balance Zone however it hasn't been completely flat in fact it's had a slight up Trend as you can see right there and that has exhibited strength at the same time on the weekly chart like I said you know we've put in a low higher low higher low at the same time you know putting a high right here higher High new all-time high that's very very bullish that's what you want to see now we have pulled back and this is concerning on a weekly chart however you have to put it into consideration that ultimately this right here is the zone that if we were to break below this Zone this is when we would get concerned and anywhere between here and you know 154\n",
      "\n",
      "we just want to buy dips looking for all-time highs so why is this such an important Zone well we used it as resistance right here right here kind of right here and then resistance turned into support and then we moved higher and broke out to new all-time highs so it's only logical that if we do pull back to this line we will use it as a very strong line of support because look at all of the areas of Confluence now we are in a weekly uptrend we know that everything's looking very very healthy on the weekly chart what about the daily chart and very similar to the weekly chart actually not much has changed overall we can see a couple of things right 154 continues to be a very very critical Zone and we have actually found support right here now this is a critical Zone also simply because we did use this previous Zone as resistance multiple times before we broke out right here to go make new all-time highs like we did here at about the 170 range very very constructive so we are actually using this level right here this confluence level as a very very strong\n",
      "\n",
      "line of support which was previous resistance you can also see a couple of things zooming into the daily chart firstly we are in a technical daily downtrend how do we know because we broke this low right here and we're using this as support however we have found support we have actually rallied quite substantially and we have actually pulled back however we are forming a higher low relative to this low right here very very constructive and you can actually see that there was big Wicks right here which means strong buyers came in after the sellers came in and pushed us higher now unlike the S&P 500 where we closed above the previous pullback High the RSP actually did Clos below that high and we didn't even Wick above it and that just goes to show the strength of the mega caps versus the overall S&P 500 industry on an equal weight basis however this is constructive number one because it is a higher low and we actually did put in an equal High relative to this high right there or a slightly lower equal high but it's inconsequential in the grand scheme of things what I want to see this week\n",

      "PE but there's reasons for it now let's talk a bit about seasonality this right here is the S&P 500 performance after a bare Market or near a bare market ends 1950 to current the returns we can expect in the first year the second year and the returns during those bare markets so you can see that the average bare Market has a draw down of 29.4% a medium draw down of 25.4% and then the firste return is often 38.7% and then the seconde return on average is 13.5% the S&P 500 last year actually returned about 26% and in the second year we're currently sitting at about 5.6% return So based on historical averages Al bear Market is actually lagging what the average is and the median and we haven't finished the second year of this bull market that we're currently in you also have to understand that the average bull market lasts 56 months and right now we are only in month 18 in this bull market so there's still quite a bit of runway in this bull market you want to buy any dips we do get like the pullback we just just got this 5% correction it was a\n",

      "going to see the momentum move higher and generally speaking 30 to 50 days is about the average based on this data right here when we do have the pullback the 4% does turn into a 10% pullback and then we move higher from there and I'm willing to bet on the fact as well that these Corrections right here were in very like serious times I'm talking like maybe it was 2008 maybe it was 2000 maybe it was 71 those type of years and this pretty much tells us that bottoms tend to be events and then tops tend to be a process so when you do get dips guys you want to buy you want to buy aggressively and you want to buy quickly now this is some very interesting commentary from Goldman and Goldman simply outlined two key risks that the market is currently overlooking those two risks are antitrust as well as the US presidential election one example relates to the upcoming US presidential election in their most recent us election monitor our colleagues in US economic research note that President Biden and former president Trump are roughly even in National polling President Biden and president Trump have substantially different fiscal agendas and the election outcomes will have important implications for tax policy\n",

      "spending tariffs and a bunch of other stuff so pretty much Goldman have come out and said that they don't believe that the US election is properly reflected into the price of stocks another area where there is potential risk is antitrust Goldman believed that investors have not ascribed the proper valuation discount to us companies most vulnerable to government intervention the government's antitrust Focus primarily relates to four or five of the largest market cap stocks in the US those being Apple Amazon Google meta and a few others the doj and the FTC the Federal Trade Commission have collectively filed more than five lawsuits alleging anti-competitive Behavior by Leading big Tech firms so those are two risks that Goldman see the market have completely overlooked now guys something else we saw this week was a lot of strength in the Chinese economy we saw the HSI rally quite significantly off its lows and it's up 20% off its lows right here breaking key levels breaking above moving averages and this is the place you want to go long in Chinese stocks and Chinese investors are recognizing that Chinese buyers are currently front running Hong Kong stock rally you can see net purchases of Hong\n",

      "above 204 but again we opened another gap down here right around 200 so again we're moving like water on iwm we're going to stay bullish above 200 and while we're above 200 we're looking for a gap fill above 204 and if we come down here and we fill the Gap at 200 and we can't hold this support above 199 to 200 then we're just simply getting risk off there is no reason we cannot move in and out very quickly here so it's very simple to say risk off or risk on and that risk level is going to be right there between 199 and 200 on the arcade ETF we were up 1.2% on Friday and we did Gap up and we did hit a very critical resistance at the negatively sloping 50 EMA right around 46.5 and we do have a gap to fill down here right around 45 so for Ark you can stay bull above 45 but if we can't hold above 45 it's still possible we're coming down here towards 41 to 40 above 45 we're looking for that very strong resistance right around 47 on the vix we were down over 8% on Friday so the vix did Crush down below 15 and I told you if the vix crushed down below 15 that would tell us that fear is leaving the market and fear\n",
      "\n",
      "leaving the market favors the Bulls to push and get the bull breakout and on Friday we did get the bull breakout so now it's just a matter of whether or not the vix can stay down below 15 and continue to crush lower towards 12.8 vix right now is telling us we are in a low fear bull market and that's exactly the read that we've had on the market all year long on bitcoin we're currently trading at 64,000 and this is a very important bounce because Bitcoin is bouncing from a very oversold condition outside the lower boner band all the way back up towards resistance right around 64 to 65 5,000 and if I zoom out here you can see that Bitcoin continues to make lower highs as it's breaking down so do not rule out the possibility that Bitcoin is just making another lower high before we go hit that price Target at 52,000 and if we scroll to the left you can see that there is absolutely no support if we break down below 61,000 so right now we are currently above 61,000 but if we break down below that level yet again that is the level that I'm calling bounce or die and bounce or die means if we cannot hold above it and bounce above that support then will die\n",
      "\n",
      "and the Die Level is going to be down here right around this support at 52,000 so the only way I'm going to be getting bullish on bitcoin is if we can break out to a new higher high and that is going to be the break above 67,000 so I do suggest saying risk off in Bitcoin while we're below 67,000 on Nvidia stock we're up 3.46% on Friday and we did break out to a higher high which was the break above 878 and I told you while nvidia's continuing to make higher lows and higher highs I do think it is going to make a brand new all-time high between 994 and 1032 and I do think that's going to happen before earnings and earnings is only a couple of weeks away so it's very possible while Nvidia is above this breakout at 878 that it's going to start to run if we break down below 878 then we have a gap to fill right around 862 and we're staying bullish above 857 on Tesla stock we were up 66% on Friday and I'm still looking for a higher low in Tesla which I think is going to be somewhere between 167 and 173 and from here I think we're going to push higher towards 207 to 225 so I'm staying bullish in Tesla but o these critical support zones at 173 and 167\n",
      "\n",
      "and I'm just going to get risk off if we break below them and I do think this is a very bullish setup we've had a very bullish impulse after the earnings and now we're getting a little bit of a retracement to a higher low before we continue higher if we break below 167 get risk off and we do have a gap to fill down here right around 147 on Apple stock we were up 5.98% on Friday and apple did exactly what I expected which was a bounce off of a higher low at 168 and then a push higher to 187 now we hit 187 and we close that Gap and there's no reason to speculate on where apple is going to go from here we need a few more days to see what the price action does and right now we just need to watch support at 182 and 179 this is a stock we've already taken profits on the trade has already worked out and we just need time for the price action to settle and we need to get a better read on the price action to decide where we're going from here so jumping back over to the s&p500 I think this is going to be a very exciting month I think it's going to be very volatile and I still think bears and Bulls alike are going to have\n",
      "\n",
      "great trades as long as you're focusing on the critical risk levels I don't think you need to be extremely bullish just yet and I don't think you should be extremely bearish still in the grand scheme of the bigger picture we are still in a bull market heading higher but we're just dealing with a pullback and the question is whether or not the pullback and the correction is over or if we're still in the correction and this is just a bounce before we go a little bit lower so know those critical risk levels that I gave you and follow price action and continue to move like water without a bias and you are going to do very well in this in this market if you want access to all of my intraday updates and technical analysis as well as my trade ideas that's going to be in the stock Channel Discord server and you can find out how to join my Discord server by clicking on the link in the description of this video so thank you for watching everybody I hope you're crushing this market and as always I will see you in the next episode\n",
      "welcome to this video where I'm going to show you how to buy the dip using my unique system and how it can be easily automated by anybody without the need for any programming or coding experience I spent over 2 years creating my own unique Bu The Dip trading system as I wanted something that worked on all assets and all time frames and something that was really robust and I could prove that worked going back a long time and with that I believe I've created one of the most robust trading systems available online and no other trading system I've seen on trading VI comes close to the robustness of the system that I've created to which I've named stock swingbot but it really works on all assets whether you're into Forex crypto ETFs and it works on both a daily time frame hourly time frame even the 5minute chart I designed it based on solid price action principles as developing A system that stands a test of time was my most important requirement for this system and so make sure you stay to the end of this video and I'm going to show you back test results for my system across different markets and time frames and how anybody can easily automate it in just a few\n",

      "\n",
      "going back to the early 1990s 30-year back test and since the strategy has only invested 16% of the time if you look at the time adjusted compounded average growth rate actually comes in at 35% well above S&P 500's average return per year in that time of 99.5% also got Quant research out of S&P Global saying a simple strategy of investing in Securities that fell more than 10% relative to the broader market index during a single day significantly outperforms the index in subsequent periods and so whenever the market rips up higher by the dip BTD makes a comeback is that when it typically works the best in Bull markets and the good thing these days with so many markets easily available to all of us there's always a bull market somewhere okay so let me explain to you how my buy the dip strategy and my system on trading view called stock swingbot works and here we're just looking at a simple daily chart of the Russell 2000 small cap ETF iwm just to give a generic example and so the first thing it does it makes sure the asset is in an uptrend then it looks for some price weakness within that\n",
      "\n",
      "Trend and looks to buy the dip into a certain amount of weakness and we can see here on the chart exactly where the blue arrow is where the system fired off an alert to go long and exactly the level where the purple arrow is is where the system got out and closed the long position and so it's a swing trading system on average about 10 bars per trade so on The Daily time frame that's about 2 weeks and there is also a built-in stop loss into my system to prevent large losses and just going back in history when the Market's in periods of prolonged downtrends there will not be any signals however there can still be signals and sideways Trends if the Market's still above its long-term average and these big long choppy ranges can actually make some really good by the dip trades and especially in hot ripping stocks like we've seen this last year or so in Nvidia stocks that are having good uptrends can make for really good buy the dip candidates even when they consolidate CU you'll still get that big up and down range often after a uptrend takes PS and we saw that with super micro computer after it had a big uptrend went into a period of consolidation and my system gave off\n",
      "\n",
      "some really nice by the dip trading signals and so it isn't just a generic wait for 5% pullback or a multiple of the ATR or anything like that there is something specific and unique in my system that I haven't seen anywhere else that I can't give away the exact Logic for as I've already got competitors trying to copy me with my own custom indicators and so how it works in trading view is there's indicators and strategy tester scripts and you can toggle them on and off so the stock swing boock indicator that triggers at exactly the same time as the strategy tester script and it allows you to send alerts so you can get an alert to your email or phone in real time and you can also use the web hook URL feature to automatically send the alerts to your broker which I'll touch on a bit later on however to test it we want to use a stock swing bot back tester and then that'll automatically show you in this tab down here the historical results for the system and So currently we're looking at the S&P 500 Index and the cool thing about this index is it's got data going back over 120 years all the way back to the early 1900s and so what you're looking at here and so what\n",
      "\n",
      "you're looking at here there's a 120-year back test of my buy the dip trading strategy on S&P 500 that time gave off 636 trades 60% were profitable with a profit factor of 1.4 that means profits were 40% greater than losses and an average of nine bars in a trade so the average trade was 9 days in length and here's a look at the results for some other popular traded assets the NASDAQ triple Q ETF 71% win rate and here's some other back test results for my buy the dip system on other popular traded assets like the nasda de triple Q ETF 71% win rate Apple 66% win rate Microsoft 69% win rate and even stocks that struggled for many years still end up winning in the long run General Electric 68% win rate Coca-Cola 66% McDonald 64% and like I said it can work on other assets outside of stocks as well here's gold 68% silver 60% crude oil 63% Bitcoin 76% and another time frames as well there's the S&P 500 on the hourly chart almost 67% win rate and so it's really up to you own imagination\n",
      "\n",
      "as to how you can use it on different assets and time frames and not only that the system is fully customizable as well so I've created unique logic to determine how far the asset has to get oversold before it fires off a Buy Signal and how much it has to pop back up into an overbought level before it fires an exit signal and you can tweak and play around with that and see the different back test results it gives when you change the system settings and so the trend filter by default it's a 200 day moving average so the asset must be above a 200 bar moving average before it can fire an entry signal and often times using the momentum filter can help improve results that basically means the asset must be up at least 10% in the last 100 Bars by default you can also play around with an index filter so that means by default the S&P 500 must also be in an uptrend and there's two different types of stop losses the ATR by default which is three times ATR below your entry or you can do a percentage stop loss or you can do both whichever triggers first and you can specify how far back you want to back test like I said I just showed you before S&P 500 back test going back to\n",
      "\n",
      "the early 1900s most trading systems you'll see out there they'll show you a really good back test result but it's like on one or two assets going back maybe a year or two and that's because it's been curve fit to the data and what's just been working currently and so even though it might show huge profits the last year don't be fooled by that what you really want in a trading system is something that's robust across most assets doesn't have to be profitable on every asset and time frame however it should be profitable across most assets and more importantly over a long period of time so you want a robust trading system that's more likely to work going forward and that's exactly what I set out to create with stock swingbot I wanted the most robust trading system out there that is more likely to work going forward in the future and that's because it's built on solid and Timeless price action principles and like I said the good thing these days doesn't matter what macro environment we're in there's always a bull market somewhere even within the stock market like for example in the year 2022 most stocks were getting hammered there's in p500 along with tech stocks especially finished sharply lower for the year however energy oil and gas did really well so\n",
      "\n",
      "you want to scan the market for what assets are uptrending and they're the best to do BU the dips on and like all trading systems it helps to keep you disciplined instead of guessing where to get in and get out that's what causes a lot of stress and ultimately losing for a lot of Traders so if you're looking for a complete trading system that you can fully customize back test on all data easily as well as automate it can easily be done nowadays especially with services like signal stack which I've put a link below this video and that basically allows you to send alerts from an indicator like my stock swing bot to over 23 brokerages interactive brokers eade trade station and many more without the need for any programming or coding knowledge you can set it all up in minutes and it's really a game Cher as it wasn't too long ago you'd have to know how to program or spend thousands and thousands of dollars to hire a programmer so you could automate your trading system and so my stock swing bot in tandem with signal stack allows anyone to become an automated Trader in just a few clicks and it's actually probably a lot easier than what you think think and I challenge anybody out\n",

      "was Contracting a little bit mikee but hey as we know the Federal Reserve and and the traders in general they want to see that contraction right now so that was actually good for the market because it kind of pushes the feds more towards rate Cuts so we saw the market really pop off ran up to 512 broke out and even held above there into close so I'm really going to be watching the market going into Monday morning here Mike it's it's holding up very well and there could be some good movements especially if we see some good pre-market movement come in here but the big news that came out over this weekend was birkshire hathways shareholder meeting and Mike the shareholder meetings are always awesome Warren Buffett talks usually Charlie Munger talks at these events too but of course he wasn't able to make it as he did pass away earlier this year and even Warren Buffett kind of made some hints at his own mortality saying he doesn't know if he'll be there next year and I don't know Mike it's a little sad whenever you see these meetings but then again to get the wisdom from such a key Powerhouse in the stock market it's\n",

      "always good to see and one interesting thing that I saw is just really the amount of the amount of shares that they're selling with apple that's really been the talk of the market here they're cutting their investment by about 133% that's pretty big although Buffett did Hint it could be for tax reasons and hey leave it up to the big dog to try to play taxes right yeah it's sad to see Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger uh get old like this but they sure had a great run and as you already mentioned uh they did start to sell uh some of their apple position but uh you know it was more for like a tax reason like you said but either way I did want to mention that because it's not too often that you see you know Burkshire selling 133% of their apple position so either way keep a close eye on Apple they had a nice run on Friday from their earnings report and their Mega $10 billion share buyback and we really haven't seen Apple move up in a momentum filled way over the past couple years like we have with some other big tech stocks like Nvidia meta\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft and others so maybe this could be the start of uh something special with apple because it has been uh kind of stuck in the mud for like the past couple years but another thing that I thought was pretty interesting from this weekend's uh investor conference with Berkshire hathway was the fact that they took a pretty big L on their Paramount position so Tom phison there yeah it's pretty big Warren Buffett said that they lost quite a bit of money on this Paramount position so they sold the entire thing off at a loss I'm not sure how much they ended up actually losing on this of course we'll maybe find out as things start to become public a little bit more but he did say that he was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision and guys I really wanted to emphasize this that not even Warren Buffett not even the king the Oracle of Omaha can win every single investment or every single trade right like he says here they lost quite a bit of money it was 100% his own fault but let's be real the end of the day the Apple positions\n",

      "more pressure it puts on the high of day the better yeah hopefully chewy can get going off support there's been a lot of these growth stocks lately that have been down around major supports and they've been starting to bounce up pretty well we've seen Zoom starting to do this as well as a couple others I know Zoom was down Friday but still figured I'd uh mention the overall support bounce there but with my first play mic I'm actually looking at ticker symbol TSM pretty big Tech stock they've been starting to break out and Friday they had a really good breakout of the daily chart they broke that 140 resistance and I'll be looking for a pop towards like 143 to 144 come Monday morning so if this stock and keep going keep putting good pressure in the highay have a solid break up of like 14215 then I will eye up those calls it's been really good to see Tech coming back lately and TSM has been one of the uh largest risers there especially at 3.9% on Friday all right good stuff another stock I'm watching Pretty closely is GDX and this is basically a bunch of gold miners all all in one\n",
      "\n",
      "these stocks have been doing good over like the past couple months but have been consolidating over the past couple of weeks but either way it's in a nice uptrend and gold prices have been staying relatively elevated um in the grand scheme of things I know they're pulling back a little bit off their recent Highs but that definitely helps gold miners nonetheless so either way I am looking at GDX to the upside in the short term I really wouldn't be too concerned about this one unless it broke below like that $32 in 50 Cent area but as long as it holds above that support I can see it making a nice move higher and I'll also say that GDX is not like some uh it doesn't move like some like tack or AI company it moves uh in a slower and more consistent way just due to the nature that uh it follows gold mining stocks rather than some hyped up AI company yeah exactly it's no GameStop which I actually I'll I'll I'll give GameStop a quick mention Mike it was up 29% Friday there was no new with this we were actually scouring everywhere for\n",
      "\n",
      "news if you guys have any big news on GameStop let me know in the comments I'll be interested to see what you guys have for that uh with my next stock I'm looking at smci which was up 2.65% Friday had a pretty good move and it actually ran right into key resistance around $800 and rejected and fell back off so guess what we're going to do we're going to go over to the book map we're going to look at that $800 level that spot was so major last week if this stock smci can break 800 with some good momentum I will look for a decent push higher to around 810 or even more uh this stock should get a decent move if that does actually truly break but that's just such a big level Mike whether you're looking at it because it's a psychological level whether you see the proof on the book map and literally see the shares sitting there I mean it's just a big level in general right uh it's not just one that's made up either you know you can get the x-ray vision on bookmap and see it sitting right there so let's go Mike $800 will be big for SN C just keep in mind that these tech\n",

      "stocks have been pretty wild lately all right sounds good well let's jump right into today's momentum trades and with the first one we have cgc to the upside yeah the MJ stock started to heat up a little bit midday Friday then fell back off if cgc can break back above $10.50 then look at calls all right with the next one we have nphase to the upside yeah n phase has been wild lately go ahead and make them break 117 50 just above the high of day all right all right and then with the last one we have TLT for both directions TLT yeah Old Faithful isn't that what we call it Mike Old Faithful y yeah yeah Old Faithful here so if it breaks above 9030 then go ahead and look at calls if it breaks under 8930 then go ahead and look at puts all right so we have the downside level for puts and we have the upside level for calls with TLT don't forget about the upside levels with n phase and C GC as well but either way these three\n",

      "stocks are on watch for potential day trades to the upside tomorrow if and only if they break through the levels Tom listed we are looking for strong consistent price action with these stocks and then continuations in the directions listed but let's also jump right into today's $3.2 million big money trade of the day and this one is with a uh I guess you could say Intel and I was going to say a much uh I'll say a chip stock that has just been gotten demolished over like the past couple months uh chip stocks have been doing great over like the past year whether you look at Nvidia AMD um smci TSM basically any chip stock out there has been running in a pretty good way but Intel is uh one of the chip stocks that is uh could you can definitely not say the same thing about but either way the big money put around $3.2 million into the Intel 30 strike call options\n",
      "\n",
      "that expire on August 16th of 2024 and looking at Intel right now uh these call options are in the money which is always good to see there's a good amount of time to it the stock is bouncing off of a nice recent support level and Tom there was news of the CEO of Intel uh actually buying about 8,000 shares of the company uh just below like $31 per share so when you see the combination of you could say big money buying in the money calls with time plus the CEO buying shares plus the stock already reported earnings and is bouncing off a decent support you know that's some pretty good news so uh definitely keep a close eye on uh this stock going forward because uh even like $3.2 million is like a relatively big big money play it really is to see $3.2 million going to these calls is pretty big here and I know Intel might not be everybody's favorite you know especially with the way it's falling down you know everyone Compares it to AMD and everyone's all hyped up about AMD of\n",
      "\n",
      "course same thing with Nvidia although even AMD can't even touch Nvidia but uh you know everybody looks at Intel and they're like well AMD AMD but I still like Intel for the long-term mic and with it falling a lot recently I've actually been watching it a lot for shares personally so I'm really going to watch this by the uh by Intel CEO what is interesting is that this big money play is actually worth more than the shares that the CEO even bought right this the the amount of shares he bought was like a couple hundred grand or something uh this is a $3.2 million big money play off the 30 strike calls now granted the CEO just adding to his position but still uh I think it's pretty it just goes to show the scale of this big money play right like $3.2 million we're right at support we got the CEO buying you almost can't ask for better uh better news in the short term on a big money play so I really like that support Mike and the thing that I like about this is the risk reward if you play this and you do keep a solid stop loss like around like 29 or\n",
      "\n",
      "2950 uh and you just play it that way it should be a pretty good risk reward ratio for like you could maybe Target like 35 37 maybe even $40 if it does get enough bullishness but I could see the stock doing pretty well off this lower support yeah and with all big money trades you know a lot of them require uh you know a decent amount of time like this option has until the middle of August so it's like if you're looking to trade Intel to the upside tomorrow then that is a completely different setup than what the big money Trader is playing right here so you know give it the time it needs but either way I am excited to see how this one does but you know looking at everything right now whether it's Intel or even apple with its recent uh Berkshire news and its recent earnings and mega share buyback or even if we look at some of the important earnings for the week we do have a pretty exciting week on the schedule I'm happy to say that uh we don't have to worry about Powell or anything like that so it should make for a much smoother trading process so I'm uh pretty excited\n",

      "December we saw something similar to this where we we started to go into a riskof environment and then we flipped right back uh we flipped right back uh into a risk on with the rally but then the rally failed and we ended up getting a bigger dump something like that or do we see something like right here right before that in the summer of 2022 we we saw the riskof and then we moved to risk on briefly turn back down but then we bottom down like with the higher low and then you got a bigger move back up to go make new highs so again I'm going to be watching and it really just kind of shows that you're kind of going either sideways when that happens or over here uh in December we were kind of in a topping process before a bigger sell off here we're in a bottoming process so again which is it here do we have a postfit bottom and a short-term little tiny topping process with our bare flag but I just wanted to show you that we did move back on Friday\n",

      "about in the 60-minute time frame that we could see this bare flag we could go a little higher the upper boundry and then begin to turn and break this level or come back fill the Gap establish this as a bottom again I eventually think we're going to 5200 and possibly to new highs signals can turn back to bullish not reach 5200 or highs until we get a bigger dump talked about three possibilities I've talked about a bottom get a bottom at this trend line we hit this trend line I drew the trend line in before we ever reached it because I believe we were going back to fill the Gap we talked about this at Great length in detail and eventually we reached it and we bounced there that was two weeks ago we bounced we rebounded we got a couple of higher lows at that trend line does that trend line now hold establish a bottom everything turns back to bullish and eventually we go up and either get a low or high at 5200 and come back down or try to make new highs\n",

      "but then we bottom out just under the 100 period just under this level and then it's a fake out and we end up coming back up and going and making new highs or going back and filling the Gap at 5200 third possibility is that we don't break this level that we don't break the trend line that we pull back maybe fill the Gap and that we again go to 5200 or uh have a gap and go and go to 5200 or try to establish a bottom that would mean signals begin to turn back to bullish and we're not there yet so we're at the moment of truth Line in the Sand is this trend line right here okay and that's where our our 20we moving average is coming in the weekly time frame again it still may be that we have to form a Divergence we did come down here towards extremes on the RSI but it may be that we don't bottom until we form a Divergence if we do again this trend line can break either for a breach and a fake it out or again continuation a\n",

      "trend extension possibly a measured move of this move so that's where we're at but let me be clear again I want to make it clear I eventually think we are going to 5200 okay whether we get a bigger sell off right now and the sell signals came trend line when we started breaking down from this trend line right here back testing it I talked about all the stuff at the time and then when we lost the 20 period we got rejection at the 10 period period and then we've been below that 10 period here now more opportunities here with our dogee at the 50 period moving average uh from Monday and then here as we're testing the 50 period this area here or a little bit higher possibly ear in early next week we go a little higher uh I think that that is likely going to be the case and then if we start to turn we'll be watching this if we go higher and hold above the 50 period moving average then again we're just right here at it right now get above it stay above it well then maybe\n",

      "you can go to 5200 or try to make a new high and maybe our signals turn back to bullish now again you've got a problem momentum has turned up but trending signals are still warning hey still could be turbulence still risk of breaking this trend line so it really comes down to that and again I know uh you know people get bored by support and resistance levels but really it really does come to that I told you the opportunity short was right there at that trend line with pow again we got a post- Fed sell off I talked about other opportunities along the way shorts were piling back in now it's a Moment of Truth are we going to bottom out get a post fed bottom or are we going to get a post Fed so off a trend extension so I wanted to cover that importance of this trend line even if we get a bigger move maybe to F get the Gap at 5200 maybe the bare flag doesn't uh play out immediately here uh again the problem problem is is that we still have the McD\n",
      "\n",
      "in negative territory now over here you got a bullish cross okay and we had this rally back up to the 50 period that's where we got rejection we're at the 50 period right now and we still went to a new low that would be a bullish scenario where we try to bottom out move just under this low just by a bit but we still bottomed out okay and again that's why I say it could be a trend extension if we take out the trend line where it could just be that we get something like this where we get a bottom and ended up forming this bullish Divergence okay and that marked the October 2023 bottom here we are we've got a bullish cross now with the rally that we've had to the 50 do we see this thing end up rolling back over form a diversion and get a bottom like that or do we roll back over start moving to New lows and end up getting something uglier something bigger uh with a trend extension so just some things to be paying attention to same thing with the NASDAQ again it's bouncing off this\n",
      "\n",
      "trend line right here I told you this these lows might hold at the 20 we here we violated the 20 we and violated the 100 period they're almost uh equivalent not quite here we've come back up to the 50 period again a little bit higher is a lower boundary of the triangle and again would be that we rise up to that level and hit the upper boundary of the channel which I talked about uh in my last update on the 60-minute chart possible bare flag and if we see it play out and you're coming down to the 200 period moving average and again the support in this level here at below 16,000 area 16,200 or so uh here and here these levels of support uh that come into play in that area near our 200 period so we're going to be watching these trend lines very closely do we have a bottom or not signals begin to turn bullish you've got a bearish arrangement of the moving averages that could just mean we're going sideways so again important to be paying attention to all this we got these bullish candlesticks back-to-back bullish candlesticks on\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday I talked about it you got the inverted Hammer followed by the bullish Hammer again is that telling us hey we got a bottom here or is it just marking a short-term bottom giving us a rally back up before you get a bigger dump just giving the illusion like it gave back over here that oh it's over and over here it gave the illusion that the rally was continuing when it wasn't we had peaked over a month ago back on the 21st of March the day after the FED meeting I got that black Candlestick and I talked about all of that at the time the same thing here with the macd you've got it turning up okay and again we're still in negative territory the divergences we were told there's no possible way they're going to play out they played out and we've dropped %. is it over and we're going to go back up or we going to get a bigger dump watching those 60-minute charts very closely I've been watching my PR signals do they begin to turn back to bullish or do they remain bearish momentum signals flip\n",
      "\n",
      "back to bearish so you can see the S&P got a candle of indecision at the 50 period as I talked about previously bull flag played out giving us a rally back up to the moving averages we've talked about this stall there or do we try to bottom out and with NASDAQ again back up to the 50 and I talked about going up to the upper the lower boundary of the triangle if we continue to try to rally so again we're at important resistance levels be flabs with the bird arrangement of the moving averages and I do believe whether we bottom out here and try to carve out a bottom now and and make our way back up to fill this Gap or if we do it at a later date and get a bigger dump first we'll see what happens as we go into next week watch these lows from two weeks ago that was again a test of those 20 period moving averages in the weekly time frame NASDAQ violated it the S&P bounced off of it so is this giving the illusion that we are now going higher as it gave\n",
      "\n",
      "the illusion back over here that we were going higher when we were going sideways and again here we are a bare flag kind of in a trading range I want to show you the weekly chart cuz we got an interesting candle but we're bouncing for the last three weeks we're bouncing off the 20 we if my signals can turn if momentum signals that have turned bullish we expected to bounce off this 20 it's a waiting game bull bullish falling w going into that 20we moving average broke out of it we rebounded back up to the moving averages you know the 50 and the 20 question is are we going to go back and break it get a bigger dump like we did over here okay are we going to do thatly breach it and try to bounce off of it like we did here and here or are we going to hold above it and Claw our way back up for a lower high to 5200 or a higher high and form a Divergence here and again eventually I do think we will fill the gap at 5200 whether we do it now or or later really\n",
      "\n",
      "depends on if the high from two weeks ago and it's three three candle bars but the happened at the very end of that week so it was actually two weeks ago that we formed that bottom so again do we claw our way back up now or is there more volatility and then we begin to get a recovery but I do think we are in a topping process again eventually I do think that we will either confirm a low or high like we did over here or get a Divergence like we did over here and again uh and and over here as well but I want to make a clear look over here we dropped about 6% we hit bounced off the 20 we and then eventually we went back up and made a new high a few weeks later but that was it if signals all begin to turn back to bullish that's what's going to happen right here right now if they remain bearish you take out the 20 we you take out the trend line then Look Out Below you got yourself a bare flag continuation pattern we're looking to see which one of our three scenarios is\n",
      "\n",
      "it going to be a breach and then a rebound is it going to be a break and bigger sell off and a trend extension or is it going to be that we try to bottom out right here right now and get and move higher those are the three scenarios and it's really all about support and resistance it really does come down to that now for the week we were up 27 almost 28 points we were up just over half a percent on the S&P at 0.55 uh again here I'm looking the diverence is played out but I told you I'm looking for a topping process it's possible this High holds we have one scenario where it doesn't and so I'm watching this closely if we get a bigger dump you get your 50 we down here you've got your trend line down here so just some things and again this channel if we just get a a drop and then bottom out and go back up and fill the Gap at 5200 or even try to go make a new high again you might form a little Divergence very similar to what we had\n",
      "\n",
      "right there so just some things to be paying attention to Divergence over here diverences that just played out to the downside you get a bigger dump well we might move to extremes before we get a diversions setting up we're not quite there yet just just uh just a little bit above it here we didn't uh go to deep extremes either again 20we moving average in my mind extremely important same thing here again we might form a Divergence again similar to what we had over here to here or just move to a deeper extreme like what we had here at the October low 2023 as the S&P is getting a higher low forming a potential bare flag you're trapped between support at the 20we moving average and resistance at the 10 we moving average we halted at the highs for the week right at hitting our 200 period there in the overthrowing it on\n",
      "\n",
      "the 60-minute chart you halted right at that 10we moving average now when you're below the 10 week uh and staying below it you can go a whole lot lower but if you can bounce off of the 20 and get back above the 10 things in the weekly time frame start turning back to bullish getting above this area then that would be bullish it's really the 10we moving average is really really important in the weekly time frame and if we can get above it and and hold above it if you have a bottoming till here can get a follow through then again you could either go up and get your lower high at 5200 right now but you got to see all the signals turn back to bullish don't have that right now it's a bearish hanging man Candlestick potentially it could be and a reversal meaning the counter trend is now done then we would be looking for confirmation a close below the 20 we and a close below that Candlestick and then eventually closing below this level which is the support zone right down here these previous two\n",
      "\n",
      "lows and if you do that then you get your 50 week way down here at the 4600 level which is it is it a bottoming tail and we're going to confirm it and you know see everything turned back to bullish already have this bare flag that's setting up now and you're going to maybe go a little higher or turn at the 200 and begin to turn back down and see this begin to play out in a continuation of this so we're going to be watching to see which candle this is but a possible bearish hanging man at the end of the trend here if in fact it is confirmed candlesticks are meaningless unless they are confirmed ndaq was up just under 1% 97% it was up this week by 172 points again we had sold off earlier in the week but we rebounded again you've got possibly either a bottoming tail if we can get back above the 10 we and look at where we halted right at the 10 we\n",
      "\n",
      "moving average here we had already violated the 20 but now we're back above it over the last two weeks last two weeks again we've gotten higher lows the dips have been bought but is it just a counter Trend because be flags are forming so again as the bulls and bears find it out for control the 10 week moving average is resistance it was support okay now we took it out now it's resistance you get back above it you can get a recovery back and fill the gap or even move to New highs get rejection here and you come back and you drop back down and take the Candlestick out next week we get a sell off then your bare flag's going to be playing out and you're going to be moving to eventually take out this low and the 50 we moving average down here at the 16,000 area so again the possibility again is that we just move slightly below this level and then you make your way back up and again something more looking more like what we had back at the 2021 late 2021 High\n",
      "\n",
      "where had a peak a s off and then we rebounded but we ended up getting a lower high and again it could be something similar to that if we can bottom out here without really doing too much damage but there is the risk of a trend extension and this was an 8% drop uh a trend extension would look something very similar to that probably taking us down closer towards the 50e moving average if we get a measured type of a move so again three possibilities Trend extension a slight breach and a bottom or a bottom where are our low holds from two weeks ago again possible hanging man candlesticks bottoming Tails if we can break up and clear our 10-week moving averages but again you can't make this stuff up look at this I mean beautiful we halted right there right at that 10 we moving average on both NASDAQ and S&P we resist is\n"
