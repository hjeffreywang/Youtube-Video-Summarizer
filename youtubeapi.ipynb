      "guys we need to talk about this right now the best Market sector being semis is starting to disappoint in earnings and this could lead us into the almighty correction yes a movement down to potentially 4700 becomes more likely as we move back into what we call a negative gamma situation on top of all of this though crypto is also starting to fail often considered a risk on or risk-off asset it's falling below a very pivotal zone of 60,000 and as we know there's no shelves on the left hand side before 52k so could this be the crash on the horizon and more importantly what does that mean for us as stock Traders as we look at Tesla AMD and of course even gold not staying safe in this current market turmoil stocks Commodities and cryptos coming up and don't worry there's plenty of opportunities out there for all of us let's get into it well welcome back everybody to The Daily Show my name is Tom today we're discussing the latest macro the data the lead indicators and of course the hottest charts that you need to be looking at it was a bloodbath\n",
      "\n",
      "across the board mostly at the close which is the most important point we'll be looking at but just remember if you want to know why these types of things occur remember to subscribe and smash that Bell icon as we do cover these things daily and we connect all of the points together rather than the narratives that you're fed through everywhere else so let's discuss what's going on in the markets right now most importantly the hot and the not so hot sectors so you'll noce healthare held up they at best consumer staples and utilities what are these they're the three defensive Market sectors and that's usually what you would expect in a riskof across the board type of session now recently we've been discussing a lot of these riskof style markets and in particular we've been focusing in on gold utilities energy and metals and materials now as it turns out the month is over and they were the best overall sectors and it's probably no surprise to many people out there when you think about it inflation's been on the rise interest rates have been on the rise and they tend to do very well for medals gold couple of things like that\n",
      "\n",
      "but the utilities component is something that I think will get even more interesting in the Horizon I wrote over on X following the links in the description down below that I think xlu May perform the Spy over the next coming years meaning that it actually might outperform completely the Spy because we are in late cycle investing now that's not to say AI stocks won't do well I think they'll do very well and if we have a look here utilities is now the best in terms of the direction dashboard we picked it early and it just shows you if you haven't been looking at sectors you've got to start putting together your technical analysis and as Dr and Miller Stanley dra and Miller says one of the greatest investors and Traders of all time you've got to be thinking about markets a little bit as a pig then you'll find the hottest areas and you could therefore outperform the S&P 500 so while utilities is going pretty well and it had a pretty good month what other things do we need to be looking at well I went through and had a look at the performance surrounding this fomc decision coming in less than 24 hours and the market acting very strange into\n",

      "the FMC usually we get upward ticks into the FMC and the actual day itself is pretty bad so fomc decision days around those periods that's when we usually see the risk off after the fomc and we generally see risk on into it now that's the last 5 years so it's pretty relevant to the current environment that we've been in this time we're leading in with a bit of sell so we need to start saying well is this Market healthy or not so when we try to answer the question of whether the markets are actually pretty healthy you've got to look at some of the stocks and of course Amazon just gave its earnings and I've got to say it looks pretty good Revenue was 143.5 billion up 13% year onye operating income was a record up a huge amount and of course AWS Revenue grew 177% year on year Cloud Revenue in particular across the board is really running rampant thanks to the Advent of AI so Amazon really doing well quite a lot of great reports there and you can see on this particular chart the revenue is significant when you have beautiful\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue curves like this then you can afford to have a higher Ford PE and I do think that this stock along with Google and of course Microsoft and Nvidia looks very good on the metrics and the charts now as we reported in the previous video where are the upgrades coming so this has not been a terrible earning season this this so far so that means that even with pullbacks coming through in general you have to expect Wall Street to be looking at that as a buying opportunity regardless of how fearful everything becomes this is a very important factor 63% of companies are beating on EPS 39% are beating on sales and 21% are beating on both but more importantly you can see here energy is getting a downgrade Comm service is getting a downgrade and as we mentioned in the last video utilities is getting an upgrade now to see consumer discretionary also getting a positive earnings upgrade shows you that the American Consumer must be a little bit better than we expect and we'll take a look at that on the charts later on to see whether that's still holding through and how you can really look at that to\n",

      "make sure the economy is expanding in a visual format it's very important to be able to visualize these things so what is the market going to expect moving forward well it's all been about mag s stocks in future earnings it better be about the rest of the market excluding the mag 7 if it doesn't come through as a broad Market rally then we're in trouble but at this point of course that's what the Market's expecting and it doesn't really say that the other 493 stocks need to do well it all comes down to the mag 7 and with Apple still this week and of course Nvidia in a month there's a lot of turmoil that can happen before that event now why is it important to often wait for the close we mentioned this all the time I've always said the close is the key and over the last 24 hours uh yeah the close was definitely a selling key everyone was selling right into it showing that we'd flipped into a negative gammer environment and most likely there was a bunch of hedging going into the close of the day well it seems like this is becoming even more of a trade moving forward and I think this is a lot to do with zero DTE is and you'll notice\n",
      "\n",
      "there's actually an upward trend of close getting the most trades 33% of all S&P 500 stock trades are now placed in that close last kind of 15ish minutes so why is that important well it means that we need to look at those points and make sure that they are break if they're breaking zones or we Clos and low that keeps that sentiment with fomc coming soon we also have non-farm payrolls this week and expected to cool a little bit but still remain very strong and of course the US economy still has a huge amount of jobs on it whether you trust that figure or not certainly open for negot open for discussion but at the moment it looks like it's still going to be good at least from most tracked records what is the fomc going to be talking about well expect pal to potentially tilt hawkish a lot of people discussing the idea that there could be another hike in the US I think they're going to be a bit more cautious on that they'll probably just hold it we'll have to see uh in general they would be happy to see growth they're probably happy to see a Nutwood mark Market in an election\n",

      "breaking up Emerging Markets also holding their own against the domestic Market overall uh Network so I think that's very very important when we go to whether we can actually continue to see a rally for the rest of the year or whether we expect volatility to be around here you can see that Wayne has gone through and he said when you win three in a month three months in a row then of course we have a negative month which we now have for April we do tend to still have a very bullish Catalyst moving forward through the next 6 months months with the next 3 months being the most potential for shakiness which is where we are right now and just remember most risk on asset ratios including what we'll look at which is the bonds Market later on is still not freaking out that's a very important factor if the bonds Market was freaking out and the stock market was coming down yeah I'd be a little bit more terrified that isn't happening and we'll show you why very soon when we have a look at the last 24 hours gold stocks took the biggest hammering of course gold down 4.72 2%\n",
      "\n",
      "defensives as we mentioned up but overall still very bullish on gold this is the pullback that you really do need to see in stocks and of course in Gold after such a huge rally let's move over to the S&P 500 so first on the surface what do we know well the market closed right on the low signaling that there certainly was selling into the end of the session and if we continue in a negative gammer environment which we'll look at soon and break through in particular 4980 then we could be looking at a bit of a heavy sell now you'll notice the 50 week moving average has actually moved into our overall defended level so if we break through here then where do we go to next I believe it's around 4700 and I think that could be a fairly large flash sell it's not there just yet so that is important but let's have a look at the smaller time frame such as the 5 minute always important to understand how the market traded during the session more than just the Futures and you'll notice here it was actually selloff during the session in general we made it through 570 which of course was a bare trigger Zone and then we just\n",
      "\n",
      "kept selling throughout the session hitting into 5035 which is very close remember 5040 being where the puts mostly sat over the last 24 hours to you know that negative gamma situation we moved into that around 5070 and then we sold straight into the put wall so the markets certainly are trading around these zero DTE when we have a look at the Futures Market action you can see here it was sell sell sell sell cell cell sell moves through 570 Contin to sell all the way down now to 518 and I've updated a couple of zones first up I think for the Bears they're going to be wanting to look at how the market interacts with the 5060 and 5070 Zone over the next 24 hours if we do rally up through the FMC this is not only the most traded Zone but it also is where Bears gain control of this Market on the smaller time frames so for basically Bears this is a very important level and things like fibs as well could be drawn from the top to wherever we end up being so let's say for an example right now if we look at this a 618 sits at around 580\n",

      "what if we drop a little bit more into the fomc meeting we go down to maybe this support down here at 4990 4900 sorry 5,000 and then if we hit that level then a 618 would sit around the bare control zone so my favorite scenario would be something like this uh and that would be actually pretty good for the Bears and we also know that 4980 is the next huge negative gamma switch area so we're already in negative gamma but if it gets underneath 4980 and which is a put support at this point that's where the Bulls will sit around this level here uh I don't think they sit here I think they sit more than likely around this level then if they lose that level we're most likely going to a new low and then that pushes that 50 we moving average being a real possibility so you know people that are looking at deeper pullbacks it is a real possibility of coming through maybe in less than a couple of sessions if we start to really see an acceleration in selling now this positive gamma switch area was of course a very very difficult Zone when you start to look at things\n",
      "\n",
      "like the Russell 2000 or of course the US 100 which we'll do later on you'll notice both were at Supply zones we also got just through that 5100 which of course was a slight positive gamma level but if we looked at the es Futures as well which we discussed in our last video we found that it was right on the res so right where all the calls would be plowing um to basically force a squeezing environment we weren't able to hold above that zone now if we did of course I think the market was going to around 5200 at that point but this is how fast things can switch and of course when 570 was taken it was always going to be continuous bare action for at least the time being let's now look at the zero DTE so we can understand a little bit better why Everything's changed so much puts was stacked in big time you can see 5000's got a bit of calls on it 4980 getting massively stacked into the fomc risk event so of course the market will try to hold above this but if it loses ground to this one\n",
      "\n",
      "negative gamma takes over completely and we start to see lots of hedging and then you'll notice that on the 2nd of may we also have the 50/50 Zone which so happens to be very close to where we think those Bears and the most traded level is so if we keep remaining underneath 50/50 over the next two sessions again more hedging may need to be done and we are clearly in the negative gamma side so because we're in that it's kind of just like the same as what we saw with positive gamma we are are in a point where if we stay low and we hold it then the close will need more transactions and as we can see 33% of transactions are going through at the end of the day 4900 remains a very important point for this month's Opex now that we're in May uh but we're far off that so I think that anything that goes underneath 4900 I wouldn't be surprised at all to see it be bought quite heavily up specifically around that 47 to 4800 Zone which is where that 50 we moving average is let's now take a look at what ctas are doing so these\n",

      "will be one day delayed so you can see here ctas were purchasing it's pretty normal they love purchasing the 20e moving average of course the 20we moving average being one of the best areas to generally add to you know position-based investing DCA that type of stuff we've seen in the past S&P versus of course the CT you can see again they were picking it up so that makes sense and let's just include two other ones I've got two other stocks that I thought might be worth bringing in firstly the positioning of of course Tesla I've updated that so 180 being a huge zone of contention in the last video we talked about how we thought that the squeeze would probably come off we'd go back towards 180 and maybe even fill it around 174 to fill the gaps that sit around that level it does seem more likely than not that this is still a very real possibility what a move almost 40% to the upside drop it back a little bit and then possibly see the buyers recommence I do also think Kramer put the Jinx on Tesla though over the last\n",

      "currently is and you know us forming what looks like a higher a lower high you know this price action is looking not that constructive for higher prices on the daily chart but again the weekly chart and the monthly chart are completely fine so what happens next well it really depends so you know we're going to have to see what happens with this price action over the next couple of days where will we actually find support will we find support here move higher will it be here will it be at the 4925 level or will we just SL PR through these levels very very quickly that's what we really want to find out maybe this was just end of the month selling end of the month window dressing we don't really know and then we could actually definitely Rally from here it's really hard to say with these end of the month flows and with such important points of data looking forward but as it is right now I do see the 4925 area as a key line of support and nothing has changed from this right here the 4920 area all the way to the 5,000 area right here okay that is the buy Zone this is where you definitely want to be buying\n",

      "stocks and you know it like I said it does get a bit scary when we do get below here but if we do pull back anywhere in this zone is the very first buy Zone you know it's a 5% pullback Peak to tro and that's normally what you want to do you want to buy those 5% pullbacks and then the next 5% pullback zone is actually like right here okay so you know we can pull back move lower and then we have a great buy opportunity right here have a great buy opportunity right here this will be a 10% pullback Peak the tro and then we can defin find some great support below the 4774 So the plan remains as is we want to look for buying opportunities right here anywhere from 4925 to the 5,000 level if we do get below the 4925 level that's when I will update you guys as to what happens next let's talk earnings guys we probably have the most densely packed day of earnings this week we have pretty much all household names McDonald's in Australia we call it macas Coca-Cola PayPal 3M Amazon Super Micro AMD Starbucks but today we're going to play\n",

      "is not the case we actually had the lowest transaction margin ever at 45% so you know um things not looking good in that front but other than that balance sheet is solid the company bought back shares they were up nearly 10% in pre-market the only reason they were down is because the entire Market came under pressure or the only reason they were like down from their highs was because the market came under pressure and if we actually have a look at a quick quick valuation on PayPal this is the current price so we put the new free cash flow figure in here a 7% growth rate right a discount rate of 11% Perpetual rate of 2% you put the cash flow debt right here the new shares outstanding divided by the equity value we actually get a fair value now of $101 and I do believe my last valuation was about $89 maybe $90 and that's because free cash flow inflected in a very big way we went from $4.2 billion in free cash flow for the trailing 12 months to 5 billion in the last trailing 12 months that puts our fair value now 33% under this current price and I do think PayPal is a serious buy at these levels you want to know what's crazy about this number right here the growth rate the previous growth rate I was was using was 9% I'm now using 7% and we actually\n",

      "server by clicking on the link in the description of this video all right so looking at spy we close that Gap today so the Gap at 504 is no longer open and we're sitting right on top of support which is between 500 and 502 and this is where we are going to have a very critical test of support going into fomc because from here it is still possible we have another higher low so the bull scenario is a very simple bounce off of this support Zone and then we start pushing higher again towards 520 and the bare scenario is a simple break of that support and we come back down for the next leg lower which is going to be right around 491 again this is such a simple Market to trade if you have no bias and you're willing to follow the price action so if you want to continue being bearish now that we're at support you want to see this support failing and that will be a price action signal that we're breaking down and you should continue shorting the market to lower price targets but if we Bounce from here and we break back above 507 and start to push that's going to be your price action indication we're going higher so just let the price action do all the talking and don't care if we go higher or lower just jump on the ride whether\n",
      "\n",
      "that ride is lower towards support or higher towards resistance it doesn't matter because you're a Trader you have access to tools to make money no matter where the market is going that is the benefit of following price and being unbiased and moving like water and remember you are retail Traders you can move like water which means you can get in and out very quickly you're not positioning for massive size positions that you need to hold for over a quarter so take advantage of being a retail Trader and learn to be an unbiased price action Trader that knows how to manage risk now this is going to be a very split room there's going to be half of you that are extremely bearish and half of you that are getting extremely bullish and I don't care to tell you my opinion right now if you're in the Discord server you know exactly what I think is going to happen but it still doesn't mean a damn thing because what I think is going to happen doesn't mean it will you have to understand that even I am willing to jump ship immediately if I see the price action telling me to do something differently but you know my plan whether you're going to follow it or not or even try to inverse me that's completely up to you but this is the critical level you want to pay attention to right here at support and I will\n",
      "\n",
      "remind you look at that Weekly chart this is still a bull market so do not become overly bearish a lot of these pullbacks if you're considering it as a bull market are going to be the opportunities to continue to load up those swing positions and that is where you are going to get that very high reward and very lowrisk swing entries on the NASDAQ 100 triple Q's we were down 1.89% today and again an extremely easy day to be a bear we had that very simple rejection from the resistance we went right up to the resistance and touched it on the nose right at the negatively sloping 20- daily moving average so a very low RIS short trade all the way down to fill the Gap at 425 and here we are sitting at support so just like Spa you have the bull scenario bouncing off the support and breaking the previous high at 434 and the bear scenario will be slicing down through support and then crashing down to fill the Gap at 407 and I say crashing down because if the Bears win the Bears do take the elevator down so do expect that to happen very quickly so again half of you are going to be bearish half of you are going to be bullish it doesn't matter just manage a\n",
      "\n",
      "risk here's the critical levels and it is possible we stay within the range but I do believe this week has enough Catalyst to get a break through this range and they push for the next leg in this market on the Dow Jones we were down 1.48% today and the Dow Jones did not get the higher high breakout above 385 and the rejection brought us back down from a lower high back down towards support at 377 and if we break 377 that is going to be your indication to get bearish in the Dow Jones for a push lower towards 370 it's still possible to hold this support it's still possible for a higher low and it's still possible to break resistance at 385 so if you want to wait for a price action breakout to get bullish wait for the break above 385 and that should be our indication we're going higher towards 395 to fill the gap on the Russell 2000 iwm ETF we gap down today so we still have a gap up here right around 199 and we did close right on top of support right around 195 to 196 and if we break that support we have a very critical support at 193 and 190 if we Bounce from here look for The Gap fill right around 199 and if we break the previous high above 200 we're looking for a gap fill just below 205 on the rcade ETF we were down 3.7% today\n",
      "\n",
      "and we got the perfect rejection from resistance we came down and filled the Gap and continued to flush and we did close down below 44 but I will tell you this is also going to be a support Zone if we Bounce from here and then if we bounce and break the high at 45 we could easily start pushing higher towards 46 to 47 if we break the support we're looking for a push lower towards 41 to 40 on the vix we were up 6.54% today so that is the Vick spiking towards 17 and 18 that I told you to look out for if we did get the rejection from resistance but you can see we did not get a spike in fear that I was looking for because we didn't even make it to 16 even though we had a very volatile pullback so that is likely going to tell us there was not a lot of fear today I think this was just a textbook day of taking profits and the sellers took over and as I showed in the Discord server it was such a very simple short trade to take that even the Bulls were taking the short trade or at least selling and waiting to buy lower so don't get too bearish if the vix doesn't get that Spike and fear that we need to see to break down in the market and lead to that high volume Panic selling on bitcoin we're currently trading just at 60,000 and we may have\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble in Paradise for the crypto holders here because we are breaking that bouncer diece support at 61,000 and I told you below that this could be a straight line flush to 52,000 so the pressure is on for the Bulls to defend this support otherwise we could see a quick flash crash down to support now we haven't closed below the support yet but it's not looking great for the Bulls and we're definitely getting an increase in volume on the selling so if that increase and volume picks up expect to see that elevator down and do not be surprised if you wake up in the morning and Bitcoin is trading in the 50 ,000 on Nvidia stock we were down 1.54% today and we're getting that pullback to retest the breakout which is going to be this neckline right around 857 and if we can't hold support at 857 we come back down towards 820 if we break 820 we need to hold 780 and if we can't hold 780 we likely go to 740 now do not roll out the Bulls because they do have price action back above all the moving averages and it looks like this could have just been a correction in a bull market so if Nvidia holds a support Zone it is still possible to get that brand new all-time high price Target between 994 and 32 on\n",

      "Tesla stock we were down 5.55% today and Tesla is finally cooling down ever since we hit 197 and we came right back down to where we expected which is that support at 183 if we can't hold 183 look for a push to 173 and if we can't hold 173 we're likely going to 167 and then 160 if the Bulls hold support at 183 we're looking for a push back to 197 and then above 197 we're looking for a Gap close just below 207 on Apple stock we were down 1.83% today and we had the perfect rejection from that resistance right around 17 before and we came all the way back down to fill the Gap and we closed right on top of this support zone right around 169 to 170 so just like I told you I'm a buyer in this zone right around 169 to 167 I'm looking for a higher low before earnings and then I'm looking for a very strong push higher towards the 180s so if you miss Apple I think this is another opportunity to get a lowrisk buying opportunity and it's going to be happening very quickly because earnings for apple is going to be Thursday after the bell and if you don't want to play earnings just look at the stock next week and decide where it's going from there so jumping back over the S&P 500 tomorrow is fomc and we\n",

       "\"good evening folks Michael Silva here you're watching the stock market brief show this is where we navigate the financial markets through the lens of Technical and intermarket Analysis today we're going to be talking about a couple of areas where to be bullish and where to be bearish I'm going to give you why I'm thinking this and what to expect going into the remainder of this week we're going to start off right now looking at a chart of the S&P 500 we know that we've seen a lot of volatility to the downside coming from the highs to the lows roughly about almost 6% as far as a drop goes and you know this is the first 6% drop that we've seen since I mean for a while right we haven't seen really any pullback since October of the prior year and we came just under this 5,000 level and we shot back up this was actually something that we discussed as far as the call Wall goes where last time where we saw this kind of bare Market 4200 was the call wall or sorry the put wall and we cut through it and we saw an under and we saw it kind of shoot back up and we saw something very similar here now\\n\\nas it stands we're just seeing kind of a snapback rally after seeing volatility and this is what happens in higher Vol volatile times you see strong moves to the downside followed by strong moves to the upside and if you pull up a rate of change chart and you look at one day and you date back five years you'll know in times of more volatility you'll see the rate of change go more positive and you'll see the rate of change go more negative too where you get really just expansionary types of volatility in both directions and that's kind of what we're seeing right now now as we're bouncing back we're coming into a rather neutral to inclining 50-day moving average right above a declining 20day moving average so medium-term we're neutralizing shorter term we're kind of down and then the longer term down here we are still remaining up now if I want to talk a little bit more in depth about you know as far as the trend goes we'll take a look at the S&P 500 on the 15-minute time frame and you'll call out that we're above that purple line that purple line is the 5-day moving average we almost came down into that today after the qra announcement a little macro report and we've we sent Rec CED from\\n\\nfrom that level we didn't quite pull down but this is a positive sign seeing the short term start to turn back up so that right there is bullish another thing that we pay attention to is the flip line and the flip line here is currently at 5090 and the flip line tells us how dealers are going to position right if it's below the flip line we're in negative gamma territory if we're above it we're in positive gamma territory when we're in positive gamma territory you look to buy the dip sell the rip buy the dip sell the rip that's what dealers do when it's below the gamma flip line you sell into selling you buy into buying and you get well you get what we've been seeing over here for quite some time as you note we were in a quite a volatile let me I'll show you the net gamma time series this this period right here was all negative gamma so this shows us when we're below the flip line and for these last few days three days or so we've been in positive gamma territory over here was in positive gamma territory and then when we had a long kind of stretch over here that happened to be the bare Market or not bare Market the 10% correction that we saw over here here in\\n\\n2023 so these little areas there okay okay so continuing on we're in positive gamma territory we're above Rising 5day moving average so those are both checks for the Bulls so that's a positive sign now the unfortunate thing is we're coming up into another heated earnings week and on top of that we have a lot of information being dropped from a macro perspective and this is where things get a little bit foggy okay so coming this week right we just had our Dallas had Manufacturing Index we had some Bill auctions and then what caused a lot of volatility today was the treasury refunding financing estimates when that came out though we since recovered tomorrow we have some unemployment stuff we have Redbook we have K Schiller Chicago PMI CB consumers confidence but I think most people are going to be paying attention to ISM Manufacturing PMI jolts and then the FED interest rate decision press conference on Wednesday now we're not going to get a Dot Plot come Wednesday so it all attention is going to be focused on the press conference what Jerome Powell says not\\n\\nonly when he answers questions but when the press conference H sorry before the pr when when the interest rate decision comes out we we kind of know what's going to happen right we know what we know what's going to happen as far as a rate hike rate cut or rate pause right as it stands right now there's a 95% probability that we're going to stay where we currently are and so that's you know if we if he cuts that'll be a surprise if he raises that'll be a surprise so it's going to be important to pay attention to what he says and posturing for a potential cut there in September or if he just takes it off the table completely given the context of hotter than expected inflation uh pce when all this stuff came out and we're going to try to get his response there okay so there's a lot of that macro data coming out that's Wednesday Thursday we have some more stuff and Friday we have some more stuff including the non-farm payrolls and unemploy uh the unemployment okay the employment cost stuff this is not nearly as important as on the Friday report May 3rd over here okay so if we continue on I want to look at what's coming out as far as earnings go and Tuesday so tomorrow right after after the close we have a big dog\\n\\nreporting Amazon right AMD is a pretty big one smci right these are big ones but they don't hold a candle to Amazon Amazon is a larger market cap so if I were to go into the you know S&P 100 over here and I look at you know highest market cap names Amazon's up there you know one two three four fifth place right other than technically six because Google has two tickers right so a larger market cap name it that one can very well move markets and then Thursday after the close we have apple as well so some of the bigger names from the S&P 100 if I was just looking at the S&P 100 and seeing what was reporting earnings let me extend this out and we'll take a look here we have Eli Lily we have I believe this is Coca-Cola yeah in a day AMT which is a am in Tower we have PayPal reporting and I'll go over the expected moves there that's I think that's in I think pre I think that's actually in the morning yeah before the open we have all those McDonald's and so forth down the\\n\\nlist yeah so a big big week a lot of different earnings are reporting and this you know this could this could move markets obviously okay so another thing that I wanted to call out here was the some of the key levels to pay attention to so not only is the 5day moving average and the gamma flip line important but gamma Labs has their own kind of CTA model and what they had mentioned in a recent note was they believe that you can see more systematic selling from a from a a CTA perspective commodity trading advisor so basically algorithms they they trade momentum if we start to get under 5100 and the gamma flip line so the reason why you know the thumbnail was like Hey you know bearish here but bullish above is because currently we are in positive gamut territory and currently we are above a rising 5day moving average so if we start getting under here what can happen well remember how we've seen things play out in the past you get rips to the downside rips to the upside rips to the downside upside downside upside and so so forth\\n\\nokay so it's positive to see this move the move has been kind of a one-way shot and it's been really kind of being shaken back and forth because of some earnings that be coming out most recent one that really shook the markets was Google Now if I go into the the book map this kind of allows you to see behind the Candlestick okay see where orders are hiding out and this has caught my attention down here 4950 and 4960 these are not small orders they've been here now for over 7 trading days or not seven trading days seven total days and we're talking almost 2,000 contracts the longer this stays here the more likely it'll it'll get filled it just it's the same thing that I saw orders way to the upside before and it was there for months and it eventually got filled and now there's orders to the downside so these are going to be interesting levels they might get pulled right they're they're unfilled unfilled orders but as it stands right now we have 600 contracts down to 4950 4960 we have about 1,900 contracts so you know what do they know who is this Trader I don't\\n\\nknow is it a big firm I don't know but that's a lot of contracts and it's worth paying attention to where is this in relative like in in relation to the Chart so we'll pull up es here and you take a look at es and I drew out these lines right over here are where all those orders are kind of are around okay which is the swing low from this area so they whoever's orders are they believe that we might see the market pull back in at some point and retest this low if that's the case I don't know so we'll pull up the SPX chart and I'll show you once again why I say okay if the CTA model is going to hold true and we're going to hold 5100 right this means if we get below this area this would be bearish and we can go for the swing lows but if we can remain above it I think that that's that's clear as day that we're going to be in positive gamma territory and we're above a rising 5day moving average and that opens the door and we're kind of in that sweet spot here whereas if we pull down a little bit okay you can get out fast but if we recoup poop it leaves the opportunity to\\n\\nstill come back up so you it gives you a very well-managed area of risk from both a bearish and bullish perspective now I'm not going to be trading myself on to the short side downwards I I am constantly looking for the way to the upside as it stands right now if I am shorting I personally like to do smaller size positions and and that allows me to kind of allow the trade to play out or if I'm doing an intraday um I feel a little bit more with that where I'm in and out but I'm mostly looking uh for for long setups in these markets because it's easier to make money from the long side than it is the short side it's just it's just it's just how things are if we take a look at the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 XL y perform the best today and we haven't seen this really slow down right we're getting a lot of those earnings and we're seeing big snaps Tesla Tesla was the big one today had some news out of China right about full self something self- driving and we saw some follow through there but on the weekly time frame if you still look at this right we came from the pandemic low\\n\\nto the to the 2022 bare Market low and that tagged right into here perfectly which we talked about the day of on the live stream we saw that actually happen in real time and we thought okay well where does it bounce to okay well take a look here there's another trend line where you see this they're all lower high so as we're bouncing still has the potential to go up higher but what I would like to see is price to consolidate for a while if that if it is going to see a big breakout and then bust out of there like absolute crazy but as it stands right now it's seeing reflexs of Bounce while it's down on the year into declining big- time moving averages so I'm not I'm not going to get too crazy into this one I'm going to wait to see how this one kind of plays out there okay so that's XL y the reason why I'm bringing up the 11 sectors is because look at look at xlu xlu was the top one of the top performing sectors today and these are more defensive type names and xlu you can see it's kind of breaking out of this you know little downtrend right here and we're seeing some strength it's been a pretty strong move so you'd want to see this consolidate but if utilities is going to continue to move higher pay attention to xlp as well right Consumer Staples\\n\\nutilities these are more defensive type posturing xlb is one that was on the watch list or the trade ideas that I posted if you're in the Discord if you're not there it's only n bucks a month you can come in I don't have the I don't have the website up there's a pinned comment in the description but I post some of the charts that I'm looking at the last one was xlb and then I also give my tight list so you can create your own stuff but I you know it's tight list trade IDE the trade ideas Channel they're they're very they're fairly similar but the tight list I'll update weekly and then the trade ideas I'll post some in there as they come out but xlb was one and we saw a nice little breakout of this I just noticed the trend line I noticed price action getting very tight made sense to see a pop of some sort we saw a pop to the upside so nice little catch there if you were able to catch it understand that this is going to have to consolidate at some point too as well so I mean I'm I'm out of the position I took profits on this day and that was it actually pretty much and then I have I think a did I take it just this day I took a little bit out on this day and I took a little bit out this day and I think I exited out fully today I'd have\\n\\nto double check I can't quite remember no no no I don't think I traded today I think it was all out on the prior trading day and then Monday I did I didn't play it okay so that's about it on today's episode I don't think there was much more to cover yeah so once again just pay attention bearish under these levels bullish above them stay above a rising 5-day moving average that's positive to see more consolidations more follow through to the upside the daily the daily expected move going into tomorrow the upside is 52.95 so we'll call it 513 downside is 5077 so we'll call it 507 and we are back above the monthly lower expected move as we were down here we said the higher probability was to come back up and we sure as heck did come back up there as far as the weekly expected moves go 516 to the upside $ 49990 to the downside there that's what's expected based off of implied volatility hope you all have a good trading session today and I'm going to try to be live again tomorrow so be sure to tune in see you later\""
