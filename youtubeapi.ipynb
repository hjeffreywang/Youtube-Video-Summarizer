      "\n",
      "Stanley dren Miller in a recent CNBC overall interview he talked about Ai and this is the guy that averaged 30% per year for 20 plus years on billions of dollars you cannot underestimate how incredibly hard that is to do and remember that was in good years and bad years so he made a lot of money from being a bear when you needed to be so he said here so AI might be a little overhyped right now but it's underhyped on the long term AI could rhyme with the internet the big payoffs might be for to 5 years from now now do you agree with Stanley dra Miller's sentiment on this let us know in the comments down below I tend to absolutely agree with him and I do believe that we're in the experimentation side right now where we're using it to help some businesses such as Banks and coders and of course many many other things but at the same time we haven't actually seen the wild speculation yet of the IPOs coming out everywhere and you'd be surprised how Wild Things got back in the dotom boom so maybe we're looking at that again uh everything will end up going into a bubble crash and then of course from\n",
      "\n",
      "that crash maybe you want to be considering whether AI really is the future and I would suggest that I think it probably is and I'm sure most of you right now will but remember if things crash everybody poo poos it in this case it's not 3D printing it's the real deal in my opinion 3D printing is more for your dentist right now in prototypes let's go over to what the vix has been telling us though because of course we have bought this chart up a few times when the vix goes up huge that's the volatility index for anyone that doesn't know and gets crushed all the way back down -20 it kind of begins a bullish thrust now we first talked about this last week and it's led into a very nice bullish run here on markets but could things be getting actually even a little bit better well as it turns out Grant hawkridge went over and found a triple 70 thrust which we have quite a lot of data for and what this is is when you've got the New York Stock Exchange having 70% plus of all of the stocks in the exchange going up for 3 days straight now this happened as of the previous close to today and of course of course\n",
      "\n",
      "this means that you have a lot of data to go through now is it all good well the answer is yes in general it is pretty good in fact 95.6% of the time markets are bullish over the next kind of you know pseudo one year and we also end up getting a median return of 19.4% so well above the average of the overall stock market now I think this is important if this ends up coming true and remember the next kind of couple of weeks can be up down and all around realistically if this ends up coming true and we get a massive another year of gains then we need to be starting to think about whether we're in an unrealistic period in the markets and this is going to be shown to us through looking at sectors and more importantly understanding where the markets are actually turning defensive right in front of your eyes but you just don't see it yet something we'll be hopefully unpacking throughout the next couple of years on this channel so let's talk about fear and greed and of course fear and strength and at the moment we're starting to see greed again and basically markets are coming back into strength in fact when you see these\n",
      "\n",
      "types of reads we usually are in 76.4 4% of the market and we usually have a very good gain in the markets of 12.41% so effectively is this good for the market absolutely and you would see that basically it means that thrusts are starting to come back across the board now that's nothing new to anyone that's been looking at it one of the big markets that you're want to be watching over the next coming weeks and years is going to be the financial markets K as well which is the regional Financial Banks that of course came under a lot of Fire back in 2023 and utilities as well which has started to improve heavily so it's not really the normal kind of Market constituents that are going up here it's not the normal way that you would usually see a market uh trade for most years and it probably tells you we're starting to enter into what we call late cycle investing now if S&P 500 follows the 2012 election year then you would notice that maybe we've got a little bit more sell in May but in general we'd have a pretty good run through to that September October period\n",
      "\n",
      "where maybe we have a little bit more of a correction or selloff at that period of time and this is one of the base cases that we've talked about for a while well either following 2012 or 1976 and we're basically around here right now which of course had a drop in it and then in both cases they ended up rallying and they also both had kind of like selloff periods with them at medium in like about the September period of the year so what about a bullish April or a bearish April in this case so when bullish April which is generally pretty good month for markets is down stocks can often struggle until Q4 now this is the data going back all the way to 1950s and it shows you can cut data a lot of different ways I'd like to basically say you know you should cut it with those thrust indicators a little bit more but if you just looked at every single time we had a down April over these periods which should be basically an up month then it can say that we have a lot of chop that comes through for the next couple of months and then by the end of the year things turn very positive with 17 up and four down so of course should\n",
      "\n",
      "you still be bullish this year I mean the stats don't lie basically yes even in the worst case scenarios they're generally going to be looking at bullish what about the last 24 hours how have markets been trading utilities one of our favorites at the moment doing very very well Staples Healthcare basically at this level this 5200 level which you'll see is a call resistance on the smaller time frames we started to turn a little defensive over the last 24 hours now that could mean that maybe there's an imminent little sell here and as we're in a positive gammer environment this is going to be the last point where Bears can really pressure this Market down we don't have too much news obviously it's more about earnings this week Disney didn't really perform very well plr got sold off uh but the last 5 days we've had really strong movements in a lot of stocks that are sensitive to interest rates in particular tan clean energy and of course the biotech moving up very very heavily across the board so let's move over to our S&P 500 analysis before we get into to more data and of\n",
      "\n",
      "course the key charts and if you think my voice sounds a little bit bad yes unfortunately I am sick at the moment but we'll power through this because of course it's very important we look at all this data and there are some big moves that could happen over the next 24 hours so S&P 500 we've made it up to this 75 FIB we've made it up to the 5200 level and what you'll notice is it kind of closed as a high and a low so basically it did a longle dogey a high a low an open and a close so what that's telling us about the day is that no one was really a winner the bear and the Bulls are kind of you know happy with where the market's at right now and they're waiting for a catalyst to push it into the other direction if we go over to the Futures Market action we get a lot more idea firstly the one-day expected moves of the options this is kind of the standard deviation that the markets believe 68% of the time the market will stay within these kind of walls and we have a call resistance at 5200 and a put support at 5180 so let's break down the smaller time frames here let's go and have a look at how the 15minute is kind of tra\n",
      "\n",
      "and get a bit of an idea of whether there could be some bears just around the corner so what you'll notice is the Market's pushed up we had our resistance at 5200 over the last 24 hours if you were game enough to sell straight on that 5200 resistance being the cor reses then uh I guess you'll be a little bit smiley face if you were scalping that but to get through over the next 24 hours what are we going to need to do probably close below the put support and close below this particular structure here now that's going to mean that we need to set an alert somewhere around 175 and if that starts to occur at least temporarily we might be looking at some weakness in this market if the market pushes through 5200 though do remember we're in positive gamma so that's going to start feeding upon itself as there will need to be a lot of hedging going on so let's explain that hedging here using the next couple of days of zero DTE you'll notice here that we have the 8th of May what do we got a huge amount of 5200 strikes the 9th of May a huge amount of 5200 strikes so basically as\n",
      "\n",
      "we're in positive gamma if the market starts to push through 5200 and holds above there the closer we get to the end of the day the more hedging that will need to be done which means that more Futures Trading might need to be purchased so in general these are kind of the most important areas 5200 and around that 5175 over the next 24 hours do we think though that markets are probably moving to the upside at this stage well the evidence would say most likely CT also agree with that statement as they're purchasing both both the C both the NASDAQ and of course the S&P 500 making new highs over the last 24 hours so CT are back on board the purchasing line and they basically held that first major level being the 20 weekly moving average and maybe we won't get the 50 weekly moving average although that could still happen if 5200 is absolutely smashed by the Bears it is pretty much one of the last points in this market on the way up so let's talk about where the opportunities are outside of the US so for a while now\n",
      "\n",

      "was the worst of it towards the end of 2022 start of 2023 and then the US economy had an amazing recovery now we have been trending lower and often when we do break the zero line this could be a precursor to us potentially having weaker economic data in the future and if we have weaker data with this persistently higher inflation that is going to build on the stagflation environment and that's not going to be good for yields that's not going to be good for the stock market but it's going to be good for Commodities and there will be other asset classes we will talk about but for now it's nothing to worry about but it is something that we do need to pay attention to particularly some key economic data points we want to look at the labor market GDP GDI consumption the consumer and how everything's holding in there and if you go ahead follow me who never miss a beat because we do cover all of those indicators now one of those indicators is actually the THS jobs this right here is temporary Help Services THS jobs this blue line right here and this red line it's actually real GDP now declines in\n",
      "\n",
      "THS jobs are often considered a leading indicator for potential recessions you can see that when THS goes below this line right here it often coincides with the recession you can see these gray lines right here is the recession and this is where we are right now um we have crossed below zero line we are in deep contraction territory however THS jobs are recovering that being said this indicator often considered a leading indicator for recession could be pointing to a recession here in 2024 maybe late 2024 2025 now at the same time another indicator we need to be aware of that's a little bit concerning is the spread between the US ISM new orders and inventories essentially they do not suggest a promising upward Trend in the ISM Manufacturing PMI as new orders are decreasing at a faster Pace than inventories the reason why this right here isn't necessarily a good thing because it means that demand is decreasing there's a buildup in inventory and that business confidence could be waning as we head into the rest of 2024 so we're going to keep a Keen Eye on the ismp PMI numbers looking forward they did come in soft last week that did help the inflation narrative\n",
      "\n",
      "that's part of the reason why stocks rallied along with Jerome pow but sof pmis did help the industrial sector and the rate cut narrative for the most part so looking at Gamma guys we have seen a huge amount of positive gamma form into the tape not surprising at all 5,200 is still this call gamma resistance and then we still have these big strikes at 53 54 5250 as well building out right here particularly this 5300 St St strike very very big strike when you look at it in aggregate we can also see right here 5,000 Remains the put support lot of negative gamma has rolled off and that was just after yesterday's price action we could see that there's a huge amount of volume here in the 5200 5100 area other than that guys it's still buy dip sell rips but the gamma flip has moved from about 51 to 5125 that's often a bullish indicator we still have this very tiny amount of positive gamma here at the 5,000 tape so someone is playing\n",

      "deep in the money calls or he's deep in the profit either way the regime remains positive and that means we want to be buyers of dips sellers of rips all the way to 5200 now what the Bulls want is just for this strike to move up that's what you really want to see you want to see this strike move up here to the 5300 strike if that can happen Bobs your uncle and then we probably make our way to 5300 by Opex but as it is right now this is a very very big strike it seems and I do think we're probably going to stay here into may but may Opex is still a while away it's on the 17th we'll see how this unfolds that being said you have everything you need right here buy dips sell rips look to 5200 as the main Zone and we will find strong resistance at the 5200 area otherwise 5125 we can see quite a bit of downside volatility but I'm still convicted on the fact that at 5100 5,000 rules will come in and find support particularly here at this 5,000 level now guys let's tackle Market\n",

      "wow look how close Nvidia got to making a monthly higher high it was within 5 cents and then what happened well we got a big old slam the Bears showed up they sold it off and we went down by 10% that's a correction a one day correction look how fast it got bought up though but why does this matter because the title of the video says right now when it says a 57% chance well after the S&P has a 5mon win streak and then breaks it we are normally higher 43% of the time or we lower 57% of the time that's why it matters right now it also matters because the S&P is currently up by 3% on the month and the NASDAQ is up by about 4% on the month what does that mean hey if history is going to repeat itself we're going to give back all these gains and close out flat on the month that's what really matters here what also matters is that we've talked about being in a yellow light and what the red and green light would mean to make it really simple we're approaching resistance and\n",

      "hey everybody Welcome Back well we have a lot to go over with the S&P but I'd be remiss in something for those that have been watching these videos for some time you're fully aware of what we've been talking about with Argentina uh it's starting to catch you on in the little mainstream today you have musk coming out telling people to start looking at Argentina it really doesn't get more mainstream than a guy coming out there with 110 million followers saying oh people should be looking here do I think it's a blowoff because of that no just be aware of that uh I wanted to bring it up because if you've been following this channel you've been watching Argentina and you've been watching these BB ARS which have now doubled uh ggal BMA you've been watching all these trades um and they've been ripping for us you know again if you've been following along since November and I just want to get get that out there so you're starting to see something up here I just think I'd be remiss in not saying that the next thing before we even get into it uh we have a lot to go over but when I get on the roll I want to make sure I get this out uh Bitcoin traders of Bitcoin if you take a look at what's going on right here you need to be aware you can't get over the 55 you've tried several times you rejected here you rejected in here\n",

      "it looked like you were going to push here and you are rejecting here as well so I wanted to get that out before we get into it let's jump right into it so first and foremost let's clean off all my levels and let's start talking about the S&P and what we're seeing with the S&P right now which is just a higher high and it didn't feel that way today with the way the internals looked in the market and we're going to look at that a little bit because I think we should dive into that just a little and look at some of the internals and see what's going on there what I would suggest is that you have a higher high and it's a clear higher high over a 55 so once we have that we have something but we need to look at what's going on under the hood for sure now with the NQ you can see right here you have a higher high but that's about as lazy of a higher high as you can really get isn't it and there's some reasoning for that now we got a little whip salt in some of the big names today and we'll talk about that but I think what's really important about this is you didn't fall out of bed and you didn't close below it you still have plenty of time to close below it and we have some big events coming out\n",

      "243 million uh their EPS wasn't as bad of a loss as expected came in at 8.19 versus an 8.71 loss expected don't get confused by that some people might because it's a it's a higher number on the loss side but uh either way Mike this is pretty good earnings here for Reddit which is a new company that just recently ipoed so with them iping in March and starting to see them push back up here I mean uh they're going to have a nice gap on the chart tomorrow morning if they can open this high around 56 so looking pretty good here uh after the Reddit IPO yeah and they reported higher daily active users than expected and a higher average revenue per user so that's always a good sign but what ultimately matters is the way in which the stock is moving and as you said they've been doing uh pretty well in after hours uh so far today keep a close i in them for tomorrow for a potential earnings continuation but uh you know what will ultimate itely make\n",
      "\n",
      "or break a setup like this one is the level of momentum we see towards open if the stock opens up tomorrow and it is just ripping to the upside and everyone is crowding into the stock then there's the potential for that like snowball effect of a uh you know momentum style trade on the other hand if this stock opens up tomorrow and it's not really moving too much or if it's just weak uh that'll kill off a lot of the momentum that it has and it'll definitely uh you know take some of the buying pressure away so with this one there's potential but you really have to gauge the momentum around open because uh it's more important than you think but while Reddit had a pretty nice move today uh another stock that reported earnings didn't and that was Disney so what's going on with this one Tom oh man I actually love Disney for the long term so I am a little sad to see him down with earnings but at the same time you know I think it'll provide a good opportunity to continue to buy into more shares here but as you can see it was not the best move Mike down 9.51 % I\n",
      "\n",
      "think close to 10% at the low of day there but it wasn't the best earnings here now I will say this whenever I start to look through here and look through everything it's not necessarily terrible right like they say streaming is nearly Break Even but the shares are sinking on soft Guidance the big thing is is like are they going to be able to like change this and turn these woses around like they've been taking a pretty bad beating here in the short term for a little while so to see them you know have this big negative reaction to these earnings is definitely not a good thing so uh Mike whenever I see Disney here you know you see the EPS it actually beat the revenue came in just under but pretty much right at the expectation so it wasn't terrible there the big thing is really just the guidance so I'm really hoping that uh Disney can turn that guidance around over this summer and I think that there's potential with Iger still taking over I don't necessarily think that they're going to you know end the year in such a Negative note like this yeah it was definitely a rough day for Disney but either way keep a close eye on it as it has been moving\n",
      "\n",
      "up in a pretty strong way since uh like November of 2023 or so but Disney normally has some pretty big swings in both directions but another stock that had some interesting news today was Apple and they had some uh new updates especially related to their iPad so what's going on here yeah apple didn't necessarily explode up as much as I thought that they might with such a large event like this but Tim Cook actually said that this is the biggest event for iPads like the biggest day for iPads since it's introduction is the exact quote there so that's a big thing to say whenever Tim Cook says that do I think it's the biggest uh maybe I I think it's arguable but they are releasing a lot of cool stuff so the big first thing is the they are starting out with the iPad Pro okay it starts at $9.99 the 13in model costs $12.99 that's a pretty hefty price tag but they're actually putting some really good chips in these like their M4 chips and their\n",
      "\n",
      "whole goal with this is to get the iPads to feel just like a Macbook and I think that's a very smart strategy by them you can actually buy these magic keyboards that connect and pretty much it turns into a Macbook so I actually really like this mik honestly I've been looking into MacBooks I might have to pick one of these up cuz uh it seems like a pretty cool deal you know you can take it around a lot easier and Etc but uh they also announced iPad Airs as well uh new updates to those models they're coming out with a 13-in model for that as well as the 11-in and they're going to use the M2 chips in those and of course they're going to be cheaper starting at$ 5.99 and $799 for the larger ones so that's pretty good at least those ones are more affordable but once again Mike you know Apple comes in with these uh these high price Tags I'm sure a lot of people are going to roast them in the comments yeah so the stock didn't really move too much off of this news um but it has been holding up in a pretty good way from their earnings last week Apple's\n",
      "\n",
      "one of those stocks that of course is a Powerhouse but it has definitely been lacking a lot of the momentum that it used to have and relative to other big tech stocks like meta Microsoft Nvidia Netflix and others uh Apple has just been kind of stuck in the mud for the past couple years so keep a close eye on it because it has been slowly regaining some of the momentum that it used to have but it still has a lot more work to do and if it can't regain that momentum that's fine but it's just starting to to show uh just some small signs of uh you know to move in a big way but um as we look at the market right now it is safe to say that the current market is a lot different than the market we saw two weeks ago and it's a lot different than the market that we saw a couple months ago the current market is a lot more um slower moving and a lot more choppy than the market was you know a couple months ago and there are multiple reasons for this but the main thing is uh that like you have to trayed in a different way\n",
      "\n",
      "given different Market environments so what you'll notice is like when the market was at a tie of day today um it didn't just fly to the upside like we saw it do a couple months ago it was a lot more choppy there was a lot more resistance and the movement was a lot slower so in these situations it is more important than ever to you know obviously be more careful when stocks are at their high or low of day but it's also more important to be deploying multiple strategies so when we see days where the market let's say has almost all of its movement in pre-market and after hours um that will still work for you um especially over the past week a lot of the movement has been happening when the market is not even open so if you're someone who strictly day trades that limits you quite a bit so if you consider you know having some swing trades having some longer term plays uh shorting some put options and doing multiple other things like that it will make the trading process a lot more smooth so keep that in mind going\n",
      "\n",
      "forward because I see a lot of people struggle uh when Market environments change and you know that's also normal because um it's not like marke environments just change you know from one day to the next like they're like a slow process and the most important thing is recognizing the change and adapting to it in a smart way so I just want to throw that out there because uh it's it's very important it really is Mike and I think it's even important to change like an your introd strategies up a little bit too like like we're starting to see a lot of these highs of days you know a lot of good rejections off of there and Etc I think that there's a lot of there's a lot of people out there that are still stuck in the whole you know buying the breakout right now and whenever you're doing that you know it just hasn't been as good you can see spy actually faked out pretty hard today on that and that's just one perfect example but there's been a lot of these good like rejection plays lately so um you know maybe adjust your strategy there too uh I know that day trading strategies can be pretty important as well but I'll say this Mike\n",
      "\n",
      "the long-term Accounts at least for me have been uh holding up pretty well lately DraftKings was down a little bit today of course Disney fell though so that uh that put a dampening in my uh secondary strategy Mike no no doubt and then another thing worth keeping in mind is like stock market opportunities are not dispersed evenly there are some markets that are just harder to trade than other markets and you know like when we have a market like we saw a couple months ago when everything was just ripping to the upside every single day in a very strong and powerful way it's uh you know there's a lot of opportunity associated with that and it's important to obviously strike on those opportunities when they happen but when we have slower periods like we're seeing now there's nothing wrong with scaling back a bit you know because when you have those choppy environments there's really just no need to risk too much Capital but either way it's important to adapt with the market as it changes because you know the best Traders out there of course get the\n",

      "fundamentals right with you know trading in a risk-controlled way and having continuously smart trading habits but they're also the traders that adapt best to the everchanging market conditions but with that being said Tom let's jump right into the earnings calendar for tomorrow yeah the earnings are looking pretty good tomorrow morning we actually have quite a bit so we have Uber and Shopify tomorrow morning those are two pretty popular companies Uber actually had a pretty good move this morning I saw so I'll definitely have my eyes on them and I know Mike a lot of people have been loving a firm over the past couple years and one of the biggest if not the biggest uh motor vehicle company out there Toyota reports tomorrow morning as well so there's quite the lineup tomorrow morning and and in after hours we have a huge Tech stock with arm ticker symbol armm I know uh Airbnb Robin Hood and AMC even the trade desk will be on the radar too but arm being one of those large tech stocks tomorrow will be a huge report and then later in\n",

      "the week we actually have Sundial and MJ stock which will be interesting as well as Kronos on Thursday along with Marathon Unity Sound Hound so we we still have quite a bit left Mike now they're not as influential as apple or Tesla or anything but these are still pretty big companies here especially like arm and Toyota and sometimes you see the biggest moves out of the companies that are you know in this like midrange I guess you can say like sure they don't have like the amount of hype that an apple or Nvidia or meta has but at the same time they're you know respectable companies that are definitely in like growth stages so yeah definitely keep a close eye on those ones and I know the uh economic schedule for the week is pretty dead but uh what's it looking like for tomorrow yeah we had cash Cari speak today tomorrow we're going to have Jefferson a 10-year note auction later in the day and then a a cook speech as well so a couple fed speakers tomorrow as well as that auction later in the week of course a couple more uh auctions and then uh some more fed speakers on Friday so definitely be ready for that Mike but\n",
      "\n",
      "honestly not too much on the economic schedule like we've been saying all week which lets us focus on the price action with I'm totally fine with here in the short term sounds great well let's get right into some setups then uh stock I'm watching Pretty closely is coinbase and it is to the downside so uh this stock has been having a pretty good year but the past couple of weeks have definitely been pretty slow and it fell by 5 1/2% today which is a decent sized move so I'm going to continue to watch this one for a potential selloff um basically looking at coinbase right now there's like a giant level at this $200 Mark but we're still pretty far away from that so like if we do see a break of around you can say like $214 a share which just like continuously bearish price action I will definitely look at this one in a bearish way but what's more important than anything else in terms of Direction with this one is the way in which it moves if it gaps up tomorrow and it starts uptrending then there's no point\n",
      "\n",
      "in trying to fight those flows um you know it would just be a no play at that point while on the other hand if it opens in a weak way and it constantly puts pressure on that low of day then uh you know the story would be different yeah that was a pretty good example today for constant pressure down I know it had a little chop there in the morning but I mean once that kind of gave out that pressure started really coming back in that was a good move down today Mike and I could see it falling pretty well tomorrow I really like that support that you mentioned around 214 I'll keep it on the radar with my first play I'm looking at locked Martin which is actually popping up pretty well today in after hours so far I see them moving up pretty well this morning as well so if they can continue this good momentum and maybe break above 467 I will look at them up in the short term now this one will be more of like a multi-day setup guys uh LMT is a pretty slow moving stock so don't think that this one's going to pop off like 10% in any given day but this turnaround on the stock and the way it's starting to get bought up\n",
      "\n",
      "off the dip is looking amazing here in the short term I really love the setup on The Daily and with the way it's keeping that pressure up here I could see it maybe retesting like 470 47250 in the short term so definitely keep watching it for more momentum that daily chart looks awesome sounds good all right another stock I'm watching Pretty closely is zoom and it is to the upside Zoom is one of those stocks that really just uh moves in its own way it doesn't really follow the market overall too much and it's still very close to some very strong support levels around $60 a share and it has been holding uh those levels pretty good and it has been moving to the upside slowly over the past couple of weeks but it's still yet to gain that true momentum that we're ultimately looking for but either way I am looking at this one in a bullish way for tomorrow but similar to the coinbase example I really want to see good price action more than anything else so I want to see you know as much pressure on the high of day as possible and the least amount of pullback as possible and\n",
      "\n",
      "you know assuming the stock is moving in a strong way then there's opportunity but if it opens up tomorrow in a week way there's no point in forcing something that just isn't there yeah it's been consolidating for a couple days but I actually really like Zoom here in the short term as well so I will keep that on the radar with my second play I'm looking at Apple Mike and we're looking at it on the book map there's a pretty good level down here around 180 and a huge overhead resistance around 185 which is almost hit this morning and broke out at so I'm really watching this channel between that 185 and 180 mark down there I think that's looking pretty good here on the chart once we get a solid move out of this channel I think there will be opportunity coming there and looking at it on the book map here we go we have that 185 overhead resistance 255,000 shares sitting at 185 every stock is different on book map guys of course Apple's going to have a different amount of shares at certain levels than something like Tesla or even something like arm so just keep that in mind but\n",

      "180 is a pretty big support down there like I talked about you guys can see it visually right here where those buyers are stacked so uh shout out to bookmap here I love looking at it for these huge levels and even for uh day trading in day you know looking at those big levels and where the resistance is and watching the breaks in real time is actually awesome to see so uh shout out to bookmap in the x-ray vision but definitely watch that channel on Apple there we go all right well let's jump right into to today's momentum plays and with the first one we have CostCo to the upside cost had a really good day today they've been recovering up very nicely off of this dip if they can break back above 774 tomorrow then go ahead and look at calls this thing has been on a runner all right and with the next one we have cgc also to the upside yeah cgc has been consolidating here in the short term but this $9 support is actually really huge here so if we see some good movement and good boun bounces off of $9\n",
      "\n",
      "and it can rebre back above 960 tomorrow then go ahead and eye up calls that 960 spot's going to be pretty crucial though there was a couple bounces there today all right and then with the last one we have TLT for both directions Old Faithful got to love it yeah actually had a really good breakout this morning ran up really well at Market open it did reject back down but I'll say I'll tell I'll tell you what that initial move was great go ahead and make TLT break above 912 to the upside right above that high of day if it ends up pulling under $90.50 then look at puts all right so we have the downside level for puts and the upside level for calls for TLT don't forget about the upside levels with cgc and then coost which is Costco but either way uh looking at these three stocks for tomorrow they are only potential day trades if they break through the levels Tom listed we are looking for strong consistent price action in the uh actions listed um but\n",

      "that is that for the momentum plays so let's jump right into today's $2.3 million big money trade of the day and it's not a Chinese stock today don't worry but uh it is with silver so it's with picker symbol SLV basically the big money put around $2.3 million into the SLV 27 strike calls that expire way out in J in June of 2025 so more specifically June 20th of 2025 uh SLV and silver and precious metal prices in general have been uptrending which is good to see uh as we all know gold prices recently broke through their record highs which also kind of helps the precious metals um you know grouping as a whole but looking at SLV um these call options are a no they're not far out of the money they're just slightly out of the money and then given how much time they have they're definitely not\n",
      "\n",
      "bad but I will also say they're more of a hedge play than anything else uh when you look at different stocks out there whether it is certain Chinese stocks or certain um growth related stocks or even big tech stocks um those will move in a much different way than the price of silver will move and that's a good thing and a bad thing it's like when you have exposure to silver or gold or precious medals in general uh they tend to be more stable but they also tend to just like move on their own and it really just depends on what's happening in the world at the time so it's definitely not a bad thing to have exposure to just understand that it will move differently and when you have um an option that has this much time uh it it is good to see so I'm excited to see how this one uh progresses yeah me too Mike and there was actually a couple other uh silver big money plays as well like one that was entered at the beginning of April so there's been a couple going on here in the shorter term and I'm going to keep watching silver very closely here I like\n",
      "\n",
      "this recent dip that it has and I actually I'm looking for it to consolidate a couple of days kind of like it did here between like 2468 and like 2515 I could see it consolidating here for a couple more days and then starting to maybe fill that Gap back up towards like 26 to 2650 or even 27 you know up to retest that resistance so uh definitely keep silver on the radar and like you said the events across the world definitely play a big role in this so keep in mind if something starts popping off again in the Middle East like Mike said this could be like a good hedge for a situation like that or just a a hedge against the market in general and I really love silver here in the short term Mike I even almost think it's more advantageous than gold because like whenever you look at Silver it's not necessarily making brand new all-time highs right like gold is there's still like a lot of room left on the table all right there we go but looking at the market for tomorrow the most important thing will be of course to adapt like we said but to deploy smart healthy\n",

      "have now a possible lower high scenario with filling the Gap today we got a dogee on the S&P 500 I you get a dogee or a spinning top it looked like it to me cuz we gapped higher we ended up coming up here and trying to form this multiple Point diversion in the 5 minute time frame that I bet we're going to try to fill the Gap and then come back up and close very close to to where we ow opened up or a little bit higher or lower that happened we ended up getting the dogee I even marked it right here what I was thinking when I was watching the chart pretty much played out that way spot on but if the dogee is to act as a reversal I'll be watching Monday's gap down here I'll be watching Friday's Gap over here the lows over here and again this bar this rally and pullback right here after the breakdown uh was the FED day and that gave us the inverted hammer\n",

      "overthrew or came back to the cloud again the signal remained bullish until it flipped right there and again when it flipped again the signals even though we've rallied up the signals are still bearish so I'm watching this closely because it has been right over and over and if we go back over the last two years it's been consistently right it the only time it flips back and forth a trending move is when you're going sign sideways F hasn't done that we're up at the uh just under the upper end of the rainbow cloud signal line even though we've rallied is still bearish so just like it was back over here and here and here same thing here look at this again the cell signal hasn't flipped back to a bullish signal some signals have but not here very similar to what we had over here after the July Peak again flipped a bearish after that got the big rally\n",
      "\n",
      "into uh you know the summer on into the September High just before Labor Day it didn't flip back to bullish and then we got another lower high and then even over here it never turned back to bullish until it was real it's what that's telling us is this rally is likely not real either we're establishing a bottom we're going to go back down form a post fed bottom or we're going to get a continuation of the trend and resume the decline with the signal remaining bearish now oscillator the oscillator is turning back to bullish here in positive territory but it did over here and that was right about the time that it peaked it uh turned positive and the very next day after that it peaked similar situation over here but the very day it turned into positive territory it peaked here it did not but again does a good job and again positive here while we're going up distantly negative while we're going down here it's turning positive again\n",

      "could be suggesting that we're going to see a peak with today's dogee or maybe we Gap higher and get a bearish engulfing or something like that at the 78.6 Fibonacci so you got a pretty good shot we're going to turn but the cell signal remains again I have some swing Trend signals that have turned bullish but I'm just showing you these because these are signals that got it right with the the counter Trend over here after the July Peak and again wasn't until we got a real bottom and a real turn that they turn back to bullish no indicator is perfect but I'm just showing you some of my again I some of my signals are bullish some of them are bearish but I'm just showing you again these are ones that actually got it right with the July sell off down to the October low we see the same thing here cell signal remains we're coming right up to it cell signal remains here back when we got the rally in July and turned or uh in in the summer months there after the July Peak\n",

      "again it reaffirmed the cell signal a couple of times so again they dropping you know we moved back up to get a 78.6 Fibonacci if we turn back and drop back below the 50 period could reaffirm the cell signal but couldn't clear the overhead resistance here and again these signals got it right with the counter Trend and that's why I'm showing you these but again other signals have turned bullish like right here turning back to a bullish signal but we're not above this line that represents a trend this line represents momentum momentum has to get above the trend in order for it to be bullish here we tried it and again right about this time the signal was turning bullish ended up failing and we ended up turning back down and again momentum stayed negative through those signals here the signal\n",
      "\n",
      "turn back to bullish but it's not being validated momentum is still negative so the rally is suspect and again we're likely going to go back and fill the gaps and then we'll see can we establish this as a bottom we get the next leg down of the selling does a selling resume I've had some signals turn back to bullish and again this is momentum this is the trend it's not validating it momentum is not back above the trend and it's not being validated momentum here going back at a positive territory or even triggering a Buy Signal here to validate it over here it did here it did but it remained in the negative region warning that the trend had not yet changed same thing here I got a bottom signal we hit the 20we moving average now we're seeing momentum turn back up but momentum still below the line here that represents the trend and momentum\n",
